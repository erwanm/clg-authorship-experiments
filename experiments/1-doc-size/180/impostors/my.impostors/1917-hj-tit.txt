that it's you that I essentially most depend 
on." 

Horton again looked at him long and frankly; 
this subject of appeal might indeed for the mo- 
ment have been as embarrassed between the vari- 
ous requisitions of response as Gray had just 
before shown himself. But as the tide could 
surge for one of the pair so it could surge for the 
other, and the large truth of what Horton most 
grasped appeared as soon as he had spoken. 
"The name of your complaint, you poor dear 
delightful person, or the name at least of your 
necessity, your predicament and your solution, is 
marriage to a wife at short order. I mean of 
course to an amiable one. There, so obviously, 
is your aid and your prop, there are the sources 
of success for interest in your fortune, and for 
the whole experience and enjoyment of it, as you 
can't find them elsewhere. What are you but 
just 'fixed' to marry, and what is the sense of 
your remarks but a more or less intelligent clam- 
our for it?" 

Triumphant indeed, as we have said, for lucid- 
ity and ease, was this question, and yet it had 
filled the air, for its moment, but to drop at once 
by the practical puncture of Gray's perfect recog- 
nition. ''Oh of course I've thought of that — but 
it doesn't meet my case at all." Had he been 
capable of disappointment in his friend he might 
almost have been showing it now. 





 

Horton had, however, no heat about it. "You 
mean you absolutely don't want a wife — in con- 
nection, so to speak, with your difficulties; or with 
the idea, that is, of their being resolved into 
blessings ?" 

"Well" — Gray was here at least all prompt 
and clear— "I keep down, in that matter, so much 
as I can any a priori or mere theoretic want. 
I see my possibly marrying as an effect, I mean 
— I somehow don't see it at all as a cause. A 
cause, that is" — he easily worked it out — "of 
my getting other things right. It may be, in 
conditions, the greatest Tightness of all; but I 
want to be sure of the conditions." 

"The first of which is, I understand then" — 
for this at least had been too logical for Haughty 
not to have to match it — "that you should fall 
so tremendously in love that you won't be able 
to help yourself." 

Graham just debated; he was all intelligence 
here. "Falling tremendously in love — the way 
you grands amoureux talk of such things !" 

"Where do you find, my boy," Horton asked, 
"that I'm a grand amoureux?" 

Well, Gray had but to consult his memory of 
their young days together; there was the admis- 
sion, under pressure, that he might have confused 
the appearances. "They were at any rate always 
up and at you— -which seems to have left me with 
the impression that your life is full of them." 





 

"Every man's life is full of them that has a 
door or a window they can come in by. But the 
question's of yourself," said Haughty, " and just 
exactly of the number of such that you'll have 
to keep open or shut in the immense facade you'll 
now present." 

Our young man mfght well have struck him 
as before all else inconsequent. "I shall present 
an immense facade ? "— Gray, from his tone of 
surprise, to call it nothing more, would have 
thought of this for the first time. 

But Horton just hesitated. "You've great 
ideas if you see it yourself as a small one." 

"I don't see it as any. I decline," Gray re- 
marked, "to have a facade. And if I don't I 
shan't have the windows and doors." 

"You've got 'em already, fifty in a row" — 
Haughty was remorseless — "and it isn't a 
question of 'having': you are a facade; stretch- 
ing a mile right and left. How can you not 
be when I'm walking up and down in front of 
you?" 

"Oh you walk up and down, you make the 
things you pass, and you can behave of course 
if you want like one of the giants in uniform, 
outside the big shops, who attend the ladies in 
and out. In fact," Gray went on, "I don't in 
the least judge that I am, or can be at all ad- 
vertised as, one of the really big. You seem all 
here so hideously rich that I needn't fear to count 





 

as extraordinary; indeed I'm very competently 
assured I'm by all your standards a very mod- 
erate affair. And even if I were a much greater 
one" — he gathered force — "my appearance of it 
would depend only on myself. You can have 
means and not be blatant; you can take up, by 
the very fact itself, if you happen to be decent, 
no more room than may suit your taste. I'll be 
hanged if I consent to take up an inch more than 
suits mine. Even though not of the truly bloated 
I've at least means to be quiet. Every one among 
us — I mean among the moneyed — isn't a monster 
on exhibition." In proof of which he abounded. 
"I know people myself who aren't." 

Horton considered him with amusement, as 
well apparently as the people that he knew! 
"Of course you may dig the biggest hole in the 
ground that ever was dug — spade-work comes 
high, but you'll have the means — and get down 
into it and sit at the very bottom. Only your 
hole will become then the feature of the scene, 
and we shall crowd a thousand deep all round 
the edge of it." 

Gray stood for a moment looking down, then 
faced his guest as with a slight effort. "Do you 
know about Rosanna Gaw?" And then while 
Horton, for reasons of his own, failed at once to 
answer: "She has come in for millions " 

"Twenty-two and a fraction," Haughty said 
at once. "Do you mean that she sits, like Truth, 





 

at the bottom of a well?" he asked still more 
divertedly. 

Gray had a sharp gesture. "If there's a person 
in the world whom I don't call a facade !" 

"You don't call her one?" — Haughty took it 
right up. And he added as for very compassion : 
"My poor man, my poor man !" 

"She loathes self-exhibition; she loathes being 
noticed; she loathes every form of publicity." 
Gray quite flushed for it. 

Horton went to the mantel for another cigar- 
ette, and there was that in the calm way of it
