" But YOU ran away from home.' 



" That's so ; but my mother knew I was coming." 

"Did she?" 

" To be sure she did." 

" You didn't say so before." 

" I can't tell all I know in a minute." 

" If I thought your mother consented to your com- 
ing, I wouldn't say another word." 

" Well, she did ; you may bet your life on that." 

" And your mother gave you ten dollars ? ' : 

" Who said she gave me ten dollars ? " asked Tom, 
a little sharply. 



 

That was just the sum his father had lost, and 
Bobby had unwittingly hinted his suspicion. 

" You must have had as much as that if you paid 
eight on your books. Your fare to Boston and your 
steamboat fare must be two dollars more." 

" I know that ; but look here, Bob ; ' and Tom 



took from his pocket five half dollars and exhibited 
them to his companion. u She gave me thirteen 
dollars." 

Notwithstanding this argument, Bobby felt almost 
sure that the lost ten dollars was a part of his capital. 

" I will tell you my story now, Bob, if you like. 
You condemned me without a hearing, as Jim Guthrie 
said when they sent him to the House of Correction 
for getting drunk." 

" Go ahead." 

The substance of Tom's story was, that his father 
drank so hard, and was such a tyrant in the house, 
that he could endure it no longer. His father and 
mother did not agree, as any one might have sus- 
pected. His mother, encouraged by the success of 
Bobby, thought that Tom might do something of thv 
kind, and she had provided him the money to buy his 
stock of books. 



Bobby had not much confidence in this story. He 
had been deceived once ; besides, it was not con- 
sistent with his previous narrative, and he had not be- 
fore hinted that he had obtained his mother's consent. 
But Tom was eloquent, and protested that he had 
reformed, and meant to do well. He declared, by all 
that was good and great, Bobby should never have 
reason to be ashamed of him. 

Our little merchant was troubled. He could not 
now get rid of Tom without actually quarrelling with 
him, or running away from him. He did not wish to 
do the former, and it was not an easy matter to do 
the latter. Besides, there was hope that the runaway 
would do well; and if he did, when he carried the 
profits of his trade home, his father would forgive 
him. One thing was certain; if he returned to 
Riverdale he would be what he had been before. 

For these reasons Bobby finally, but very reluc- 
tantly, consented that Tom should remain with him, 
resolving, however, that, if he did not behave himself, 
he would leave him at once. 

Before morning he had another reason. When the 
steamer got out into the open bay, Bobby was sea- 



 

sick. He retired to his berth with a dreadful head- 
ache ; as he described it afterwards, it seemed just as 
though that great walking beam was smashing up 
and down right in the midst of his brains. He had 
never felt so ill before in his life, and was very sure, 
in his inexperience, that something worse than mere 
seasickness ailed him. 

He told Tom, who was not in the least affected, 
how he felt ; whereupon the runaway blustered 
round, got the steward and the captain into the 
cabin, and was very sure that Bobby would die be- 
fore morning, if we may judge by the fuss he made. 

The captain was angry at being called from the 
pilot house for nothing, and threatened to throw Tom 
overboard if he didn't stop his noise. The steward, 
however, was a kind-hearted man, and assured Bobby 
that passengers were often a great deal sicker than 
he was ; but he promised to do something for his re- 
lief, and Tom went with him to his state room for 
the desired remedy. 

The potion was nothing more nor less than a 
table spoonful of brandy, which Bobby, who had 
conscientious scruples about drinking ardent spa-its, 


at first refused to take. Then Tom argued the 
point, and the sick boy yielded. The dose made 
him sicker yet, and nature came to his relief, and in 
a little while he felt better. 

Tom behaved like a good nurse ; he staid by his 
friend till he went to sleep, and then " turned in " 
upon a settee beneath his berth. The boat pitched 
and tumbled about so in the heavy sea that Bobby 
did not sleep long, and when he woke he found Tom 
ready to assist him. But our hero felt better, and 
entreated Tom to go to sleep again. He made the 
best of his unpleasant situation. Sleep was not to 
be wooed, and he tried to pass away the dreary hours 
in thinking of Biverdale and,- the dear ones there. 
His mother was asleep, and Annie was asleep ; and 
that was about all the excitement he could get up 
even on the home question. He could not build 
castles in the air, fqr seasickness and castle building 
do not agree. The gold and purple clouds would be 
black in spite of him, and the aerial structure he es- 
sayed to build would pitch and tumble about, for all 
the world, just like a steamboat in a heavy sea. As 
often as he got fairly into it, he was violently rolled 



 

out, and in a twinkling found himself in his narrow 
berth, awfully seasick. 

He went to sleep again at last, and the long night 
passed away. When he woke in the morning, he felt 
tolerably well, and was thankful that he had got out 
of that scrape. But before he could dress himself, he 
heard a terrible racket on deck. The steam whistle 
was shrieking, the bell was banging, and he heard 
the hoarse bellowing of the captain. It was certain 
that something had happened, or was about to hap- 
pen. 

Then the boat stopped, rolling heavily in the sea. 
Tom was not there ; he had gone on deck. Bobby 
was beginning to consider what a dreadful thing a 
wreck was, when Tom appeared. 

"What's the matter?' asked Bobby, with some 
appearance of alarm. 

" Fog," replied Tom. " It is so thick you can cut 
it with a hatchet." 

" Is that all ? " 

" That's enough."
