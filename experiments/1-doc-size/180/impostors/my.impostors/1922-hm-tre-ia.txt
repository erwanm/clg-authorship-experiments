'' Auntie?" he cried. 

"Yes, Auntie! And to date you have cost me 
precisely sixteen thousand dollars —  hard earned, 
every one of them." 

Spurlock wondered if something hadn't suddenly 
gone awry in his head. He had just passed through 






 

a terrific physical test. Surely lie was imagining this 
picture. His aimt, here at McClintock's? It was 
unbelievable. He righted a chair and sat in it, his 
face in his hands. But when he looked again, there 
she was! 

I don't imderstand ' he said, finally. 
You will before I'm done with you. I have come 
to take you home; and hereafter my word will be the 
law. You will obey me out of common decency. 
You can scribble if you want to, but after you've 
given your eight hours daily to the mills. Sixteen 
thousand ! Mark me, young man, you'll pay it back 
through the nose, every dollar of it ! " 

''I owe you nothing." Pain was stabbing him, 
now here, now there; pain was real enough; but he 
could not establish as a fact in his throbbing brain 
the presence of his aimt in the doorway. "I owe 
you nothing," he repeated, dully. 

"Hoity-toity! You owe me sixteen thousand 
dollars. They were very nice about it, in memory of 
your father. They telephoned that you had ab- 
sconded with ten thousand, and that if I would make 
good the loss within twenty-four hours, they would 
not prosecute. I sent my check for ten thousand; 
and it has cost me six thousand to find you. I should 
say that you owed me considerable." 

Still his brain refused to assimilate the news or to 
deduce the tremendous importance of it. 

"You are Ruth?" 





"Yes," said Ruth, stirred by anger and bitterness 
and astonishment. This, then, was the woman from 
whom Hoddy would not have accepted a cup of water. 

"Come here ' said the petticoated tyrant. Ruth 
obeyed, not willingly, but because there was some- 
thing hypnotic in the authoritative tone. "Put 
your arms about me." Ruth di<f so, but without 
any particular fervour. ''Kiss me." Ruth slightly 
brushed the withered cheek. The aimt laughed. 
"Love me, love my dog! Because IVe scolded him 
and told him a few truths, you are ice to me. Not 
afraid of me, either." 

"No," said Ruth, pulling back. 

But the aunt seized her in her arms and rocked 
with her. "A miserly old woman. Well, IVe had 
to be. All my life IVe had to fight human wolves to 
hold what I have. So IVe grown hard — outside. 
What's all this about, anyhow? You. Far away 
there was the one woman for this boy of mine —  some 
human being who would imderstand the dear fool 
better than all the rest of the world. But God did 
not put you next door. He decided that Hoddy 
should pay a colossal price for the Dawn Pearl — 
shame, loneliness, torment, for only through these 
agencies would he learn your worth. The fibre of 
his soul had to be tested, queerly, to make him 
worthy of you. Through fire and water, through 
penury and pestilence, your hand will always be on 
Ms shoulder. McClintock wrote me about you; 



 

but all I needed was the sight of your face as it was 
a moment gone." 

Gently she thrust Ruth aside. Ruth's eyes were 
wet, but she saw light everywhere: the room was 
filled with celestial aura. 

The aunt rushed over to her nephew, knelt and 
wrapped him in her arms. " My little Hoddy ! You 
used to love me; and I have always loved you. The 
thought of you, wandering from pillar to post, be- 
lieving yourself hunted — it tore my old heart to 
pieces! For I knew you. You would suffer the 
torments of the damned for what you had done. 
So I set out to find you, even if it cost ten times six- 
teen thousand. My poor Hoddy! I had to talk 
harshly, or break down and have hysterics. IVe 
come to take you back home. Don't you under- 
stand? Back among your own again, and only a 
few of us the wiser. Have you suflFered?" 
"Dear God! . . . every hour since!" 
"The Spurlock conscience. That is why Wall 
Street broke your father; he was honest." 

"Ah, my father! The way you treated him. . . !" 
"Good money after bad. You haven't heard my 
side if it, Hoddy. To shore up a business that never 
had any foundation, he wanted me to lend him a 
hundred thousand; and for his sake as well as for 
mine I had to refuse. He wasn't satisfied with an 
assured income from the paper-mills your grand- 
father left us. He wanted to become a millionaire. 



SIO The Ragged Edge 

So I had to buy out his interest, and it pinched me 
dreadfully to do it. In the end he broke his own 
heart along with your mother's. I even o£Pered him 
back the half interest he had sold to me. You sent 
back my Christmas checks.'' 

''I had to. I couldn't accept anything from you." 

"You might have added 'then'," said. Miss Spur- 
lock, drily. 

" I'm an ungrateful dog ! " 

''You will be if you don't instantly kiss me the 
way you used to. But your face! What happened 
here just before I came?" 

"Perhaps God wasn't quite sure that I could hold 
what I had, and wanted to try me out." 

"And you whipped the beast? I passed him." 

''At any rate, I won, for he went away. But» 
Auntie, however in this world did you find this 
island?" 

She told him. "The chief of the detective agency 
informed me that it would be best not to let Mr. 
O'Higgins know the truth; he wouldn't be reckless 
with the funds, then. For a time I didn't know 
we'd ever find you. Then came the cable that you 
were in Canton, ill, but not dangerously so. Mr. 
O'Higgins was to keep track of you imtil I believed 
you had had enough punishment. Then he was to 
arrest you and bring you home to me. When I 
learned you were married, I changed my plans. I 
'd not know what God had in mind then. Mr. 



 

Olliggms and I landed at Copeley's yesterday; 
and Mr. McCIintock sent his yacht over for us this 
morning. Hoddy, what made you do it? What- 
ever made you do it?" 

' God knows! Something said to me: Take it! 
Take it! And ... I took it. After I took the 
bil  it was too late to turn back. I drew out what 
I had saved and boarded the first ship out. Wait ! "
