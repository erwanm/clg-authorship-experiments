" Oh, my good gracious ! " cried Miss 
Delancey. "Why, she sha n t! Why, I wouldn't 



be hired to sleep alone one night, for any 
money you could give me. My sister Belle 
always has to sleep with me at home ; and if 
she is away visitiag, I make mother come ; or 
else I have one of the servants sleep on the 
couch. Why, I should die of fright before 
morning ! " 

"Fright! What can you find to be afraid 
of, I should like to know? " 

" Oh, I don't know ; robbers, and ghosts, 
and spiritual rappings, and fifty things. I have 
an aunt who saw her candlestick walk right 
out into the air off the mantelpiece, one night, 
and how do I know but that I should see mine 
walking, if I slept alone ! I always cover my 
head up in the clothes, anyway, and I always 
make Josephine sleep the front side; don't I, 
Jo?" 

"Were?" said contemptuous Gypsy, slowly. 
" If I enjoyed being an infant, I 'd be an infant, 
but it would be a good while before I would 
boast of it." 

" It is very nice to talk," said Jacqueline, 






colouring, " but I should like to know what 
you want of my room-mate if you re not afraid 
just as much as I am." 

" I want her because she is funny, and good 
company to have round, and I never was afraid 
to sleep alone, since I dispensed with nurses ! 
If you won't believe me, I 'll go and spend a 
night up garret, for I should be ashamed to 
have anybody think I was afraid." 

Now, the garret at the Golden Crescent was 
a dismal place; dark with cobwebs, frowning 
with shadows, ghostly with old quilts and cast- 
off garments ; moreover, the wind shrieked, 
with an extremely unpleasant sound, down the 
huge old-fashioned chimneys. Therefore, in 
credulous Jacqueline screamed at Gypsy 's pro 
posal, and said that it made her cold so much 
as to think of it. 

Gypsy made herself up a bed under the 
eaves, and at nine o'clock that night, went up, 
a stout-faced, white-robed little figure, dragging 
a pillow, and slept there, true to her word, till 
morning. 


Jacqueline went up herself at six o'clock 
to wake her, and be sure that there was no 
hoax about it. 

The girls rushed to Gypsy 's room while she 
was dressing, to hear about it. 

" How did you ever dare to? " 

" Weren't you awfully scared? " 

" Didn't you lie awake all night?" 

"And didn't you once think you saw a 
ghost?" 

" Or a candlestick walking? " 

" Oh, I wouldn't have done it for anything ! ** 

Nor I ! " 

" Think of it ! " 

" Such a quantity of rats and spiders ! Why, 
I 'm as afraid of a mouse as I can be." 

" Well," said Jacqueline, finishing the chorus, 
" it is very well for you ; you don't mind thun 
der-showers, and you didn't scream when we 
upset on that sleigh-ride, and you re not afraid 
of robbers, but I am nervous. I am so timid 
mother says I am the most timid child she 

ever had." 


It required all Gypsy 's politeness to keep 
out of her face and tones the little flash of 
scorn with which she heard this remark. 

"Jacqueline Delancey, you really talk as 
if you thought it were a pretty thing to be 
timid ! " 

And Jacqueline looked very much as if she 
thought so, which was more. 

" I really don't see," persisted Gypsy, "I 
really don't see why a girl should be a goose, 
because she is a girl. Now, if my brother Tom 
were here, and had slept up garret, would you 
ask him if he was afraid, or would you think it 
an insult? " 

" Of course I shouldn't ask him ! " 

" Well, then, if it would be unmanly in him 
to be afraid of nothing, I say it is unwomanly 
in me to be afraid of nothing, and what 's more 
I won't be ! Now, where did I leave that hair 
brush?" 

Mademoiselle, when she heard of the matter, 
proposed to sleep with Jacqueline, in order that 
Jo might be free to make the visit to Sky 



Parlour. The offer must have been quite a little 
sacrifice on the part of the French Teacher, for 
Miss Delancey was anything but an agreeable 
room-mate, had always been one of her most 
troublesome scholars, and had barely treated 
her with civility. It was evident that Made 
moiselle had taken a fancy to Gypsy. 

So Josephine " struck tents," as she said, 
with Gypsy, for the time in which her room 
mate should be away. The time became a 
week, became a fortnight, and Jane had not 
come, nor Maude. 

Put two such impulsive, out-spoken girls as 
Jo and Gypsy in the same room, on equal foot 
ing of privilege, for fourteen days, and they are 
apt at the end to understand each other about 
as well as they would in fourteen years. Had 
Maude Clare, instead of Jo, been subjected to 
the test, Gypsy would not have been so long in 
discovering some things that she did discover 
about her friend. Josephine was one of those 
people whose faults and virtues, equally, make 

more impression on one the more one knows 


of them : the faults were not easily " put tip 
with : " the virtues did not lessen through 
familiarity. 

She was, unmistakably, what Gypsy had pro 
nounced her, " good company." She was 
well, and strong, and happy; never had head 
aches or " blues ; " never was homesick, never 
cried or moped ; she overflowed with fun and 
jest, nine-tenths of it girl 's pointless chatter, 
one-tenth genuine wit. Moreover, she had a 
good large Western heart, that took in with 
especial fervour the person with whom she 
happened to be at any particular moment. A 
generous room-mate she certainly was; she 
never growled at making the bed ; she took her
