and Aunt Betsy rose to go, she stopped to ask a 
question : 

"How does things come on between Roweny and 
Tom Driscoll?" 





 

"Well, about the same. He writes tolerable 
often, and she answers tolerable seldom." 

"Where is he?" 

"In St. Louis, I believe, though he's such a gad- 
about that a body can't be very certain of him, I 
reckon." 

"Don't Roweny know?" 

"Oh, yes, like enough. I haven't asked her lately. ' ' 

"Do you know how him and the Judge are get- 
ting along now?" 

"First rate, I believe. Mrs. Pratt says so; and 
being right in the house, and sister to the one and 
aunt to t'other, of course she ought to know. She 
says the Judge is real fond of him when he's away; 
but frets when he's around and is vexed with his 
ways, and not sorry to nave him go again. He has 
been gone three weeks this time — a pleasant thing 
for both of them, I reckon." 

"Tom's ruther harum-scarum, but there ain't 
anything bad in him, I guess." 

"Oh, no, he's just young, that's all. Still, 
twenty- three is old, in one way. A young man 
ought to be earning his living by that time. If 
Tom were doing that, or was even trying to do it, 
the Judge would be a heap better satisfied with him. 
Tom's always going to begin, but somehow he can't 
seem to find just the opening he likes." 

"Well, now, it's partly the Judge's own fault. 
Promising the boy his property wasn't the way to 
set him to earning a fortune of his own. But what 
do you think — is Roweny beginning to lean any 
toward him, or ain't she?" 





 

Aunt Patsy had a secret in her bosom; she 
wanted to keep it there, but nature was too strong 
for her. She drew Aunt Betsy aside, and said in 
her most confidential and mysterious manner: 

"Don't you breathe a syllable to a soul — I'm 
going to tell you something. In my opinion Tom 
Driscoll's chances were considerable better yester- 
day than they are to-day." 

"Patsy Cooper, what do you mean?" 

"It's so, as sure as you're born. I wish you 
could 'a' been at breakfast and seen for yourself." 

"You don't mean it!" 

"Well, if I'm any judge, there's a leaning — 
there's a leaning, sure." 

"My land! Which one of 'em is it?" 

"I can't say for certain, but I think it's the 
youngest one — Anjy." 

Then there were handshakings, and congratula- 
tions, and hopes, and so on, and the old ladies 
parted, perfectly happy — the one in knowing some- 
thing which the rest of the town didn't, and the 
other in having been the sole person able to furnish 
that knowledge. 

The visitor who had called to see the twins was 
the Rev. Mr. Hotchkiss, pastor of the Baptist 
church. At the reception Angelo had told him he 
had lately experienced a change in his religious 
views, and was now desirous of becoming a Baptist, 
and would immediately join Mr. Hotchkiss's church. 
There was no time to say more, and the brief talk 
ended at that point. The minister was much grati- 
fied, and had dropped in for a moment now, to 





 

invite the twins to attend his Bible class at eight 
that evening. Angelo accepted, and was expecting 
Luigi to decline, but he did not, because he knew 
that the Bible class and the Free-thinkers met in the 
same room, and he wanted to treat his brother to 
the embarrassment of being caught in free-cninking 
company. 



CHAPTER V 

GUILT AND INNOCENCE FINELY BLENT 

[A long and vigorous quarrel follows, between the twins. And 
there is plenty to quarrel about, for Angelo was always seeking 
truth, and this obliged him to change and improve his religion 
with frequency, which wearied Luigi, and annoyed him too; 
for he had to be present at each new enlistment — which placed 
him in the false position of seeming to indorse and approve his 
brother's fickleness; moreover, he had to go to Angelo 's pro- 
hibition meetings, and he hated them. On the other hand, 
when it was his week to command the legs he gave Angelo just 
cause of complaint, for he took him to circuses and horse-races 
and fandangoes, exposing him to all sorts of censure and criticism; 
and he drank, too; and whatever he drank went to Angelo 's 
head instead of his own and made him act disgracefully. When 
the evening was come, the two attended the Free-thinkers' meet- 
ing, where Angelo was sad and silent; then came the Bible 
class and looked upon him coldly, finding him in such company. 
Then they went to Wilson's house and Chapter XI of Pudd'nhead 
Wilson follows, which tells of the girl seen in Tom Driscoll's 
room; and closes with the kicking of Tom by Luigi at the anti- 
temperance mass -meeting of the Sons of Liberty; with the 
addition of some account of Roxy's adventures as a chamber- 
maid on a Mississippi boat. Her exchange of the children had 
been flippantly and farcically described in an earlier chapter.] 

NEXT morning all the town was a-buzz with great 
news ; Pudd'nhead Wilson had a law case ! The 
public astonishment was so great and the public curi- 
osity so intense, that when the justice of the peace 
opened his court, the place was packed with people, 
and even the windows were full. Everybody was 

flushed and perspiring; the summer heat was almost 
unendurable. 

Tom Driscoll had brought a charge of assault and 
battery against the twins. Robert Allen was re- 
tained by Driscoll, David Wilson by the defense. 
Tom, his native cheerfulness unannihilated by his 
back-breaking and bone-bruising passage across the 
massed heads of the Sons of Liberty the previous 
night, laughed his little customary laugh, and said 
to Wilson: 

"I've kept my promise, you see; I'm throwing 
my business your way. Sooner than I was expect- 
ing, too." 

"It's very good of you — particularly if you 
mean to keep it up." 

"Well, I can't tell about that yet. But we'll see. 
If I find you deserve it I'll take you under my pro- 
tection and make your fame and fortune for you." 

"I'll try to deserve it, Tom." 

A jury was sworn in; then Mr. Allen said:
