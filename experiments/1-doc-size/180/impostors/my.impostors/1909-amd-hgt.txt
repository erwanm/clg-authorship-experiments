this way. Now if you were the school- 
teacher ” 

“Ah! You see I had no grand ideas of 
renovating the world in those youthful days. 
I wanted a home and a pleasant life, a husband 
not too exigent. Miss Grant, is this heresy to 
your thinking? ” 

Helen smiled. “ It sounds very pleasant,” 
she said. 

“What is pleasant?” Mr. Underwood 
entered the room and shook hands first with 
Helen, as she was nearest. “ If it is the past 
week, you are made of excellent material.” 

“ Indeed it is not,” protested his wife. “ I 
was airing my ideas of setting out with the 
ordinary aim, not demanding too much, and 
working with all your mind and heart to get 
the thing you merit.” 

“ I suppose, then, Miss Grant agreed with 
you.” 

“ Every one may not have the same aim or 
be satisfied with the same — shall we call it 
destiny ? But I think it a good plan to set out 
earnestly for some particular thing.” 

“ In my case it was the husband.” 



She looked up at him with a merry glint in 
her eyes. 

“ And you see how well she succeeded.’ 

“ I shall advise them to go and do like- 
wise.” 

“ I don’t know how I would manage with- 
out Miss Parker. But if the man was admir- 
able in every respect ” 

“ They are not all admirable,” Miss Parker 
returned rather shortly, with a touch of 
disgust. 

“ The banquet waits,” announced Mrs. Un- 
derwood at a signal from her impromptu maid. 
“ I sent word to Miss Grant that you would 
talk shop. It won’t bore me at all. I know 
you must want to compare notes.” 

Mr. Underwood seated the ladies. The 
dainty oysters at each place looked tempting. 

“ Did you find it very severe, Miss Grant ? 
I looked for you to offer a word of condolence, 
but you disappeared so suddenly. And no 
one seemed to know where you had gone.” 

Helen flushed a little at the thought of her 
escapade, if indeed it was that. 

“ Why,” hesitatingly, “ I had not counted 


 

on tranquil seas and smooth sailing. We were 
all strangers and I had to learn, or at least 
make allowance for their ways and training of 
which I knew next to nothing.” 

“ And the heat was enough to drive one 
half crazy,” added Miss Parker. “ I don’t 
know that we ever had such a bad begin- 
ning. There were five new children from 
over the river, but I sincerely wish they had 
not been granted the privilege. I do not be- 
lieve they can keep their standing.” 

“ Scholarship is not very high over there,” 
nodded Mr. Underwood. “ There is a Miss 
Winters, Georgia Winters, who graduated and 
has spent a year in a private school. Can you 
recall her, Miss Grant?” 

Helen thought a moment. “ My mind is 
not quite a directory yet,” she returned laugh- 
ingly. 

“ A tall girl, with rather pretty chestnut hair 
that just missed being red. Her mother con- 
siders her a very fine scholar, quite proficient 
in Latin and French.” 

“ Oh ! I think I can recall her. She must 


be sixteen at least.” 



“ Yes. Her mother thought a year in the 
high school would enable her to graduate.’’ 

“ The first form in Latin is going to be 
rather full,” began Helen dryly. “ Un- 
less ” 

“ They must be rated according to their 
attainments. We cannot begin by lowering 
oar standard. And you will not be able to 
find their exact places at once.” 

“ And how do you like boys?” asked Miss 
Parker. 

Helen flushed. “ I have known a good 
many and grew up with some of them.” 

“ But a woman’s college must be very dif- 
ferent from — well, a public school.” 

Miss Parker had a little soreness of heart. 
She wished she had been able to fill the place. 
There had been no room for college in her 
busy life. She had taught eighteen years, 
working up from a primary grade in the larger 
town of Camden. She had been here eight 
years. Mr. Underwood soon learned her 
capabilities and had her promoted. Last year 
she could have been principal in a smaller 
school but there was no higher salary. She 


 

liked to work with Mr. Underwood, and he 
thoroughly appreciated her. She was a fine 
disciplinarian, an excellent teacher. 

“ I should like to see you at the head of this 
new school,” he had said to her, ‘‘but I 
should miss you tremendously. We pull to- 
gether so harmoniously, we fall so into each 
other’s methods. But they have decided upon 
a graduate fresh from college. I suppose it is 
needed. We go in for the higher things now- 
adays, and we do want to turn out first-class 
scholarship.” 

“ Yes, I should be proud to fill such a posi- 
tion. But I couldn’t construe a page of Latin 
or write an hexameter, and I have just a smat- 
tering of several ’ologies. I had a vague idea 
once that I would study up in the higher 
branches, but I guess my knowledge will suf- 
fice me. When I get sufficient money saved 
I shall retire,” with an abrupt and rather 
scornful laugh, “ or some inconsolable wid- 
ower may take pity on me and offer me a 
home.” 

Marcia Parker’s sad little romance had 
leaked out. Some friend who had known her 


 

told it to her credit. There had been a par- 
tially paralyzed mother and an old father, and 
two brothers who felt free to marry as soon 
as they were in any position to support a wife. 
She had struggled along until the old father
