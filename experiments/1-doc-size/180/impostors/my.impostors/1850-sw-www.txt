" Ellen dear," said Alice as she poured out Ellen's 
second cup of tea, " have we run through the list of your 
troubles ?" 

" no Miss Alice, indeed we haven't ; but we have got 
through the worst." 

Is the next one so bad it would spoil our supper ?" 

"No," said Ellen, "it couldn't do that, but it's bad 
enough though ; it's about my not going to school. Miss 
Alice, I promised myself I would learn so much while mamma 
was away, and surprise her when she came back, and instead 
of that f am not learning anything. I don't mean not learning anything" said Ellen correcting herself ; — " but I can't 
do much. When I found aunt Fortune wasn't going to send 
me to school I determined I would try to study by myself; 
and I have tried ; but I can't get along." 

" Well now don't lay down your knife and fork and look 
so doleful," said Alice smiling ; "this is a matter I can help 
you in. What are you studying ?" 

" Some things I can manage well enough," said Ellen, 
"the easy things; but I cannot understand my arithmetic 
without some one to explain it to me, and French I can do 
nothing at all with, and that is what I wanted to learn most 
of all ; and often I want to ask questions about my history." 

"Suppose," said Alice, "you go on studying by yourself 
as much and as well as you can, and bring your books up to 
me two or three times a week ; I will hear and explain and 
answer questions to your heart's content, unless you should 
be too hard for me. What do you say to that ?" 

Ellen said nothing to it, but the color that rushed to her 
cheeks, — the surprised look of delight, — were answer enough. 





" It will do then," said Alice ; " and I have no doubt we 
shall untie the knot of those arithmetical problems very soon. 
But Ellen my dear I cannot help you in French, for I do not 
know it myself. What will you do about that ?" 

" I don't know ma'am ; I am sorry." 

** So am I, for your sake. I can help you in Latin, if that 
would be any comfort to you." 

" It wouldn't be much comfort to me," said Ellen laughing ; " mamma wanted me to learn Latin but I wanted to 
learn French a great deal more ; I don't care about Latin except to please her." 

" Permit me to ask if you know English ?" 

"0 yes ma'am, I hope so; I knew that a great while 
ago."  

" Did you ? I am very happy to make your acquaintance 
then, for the number of young ladies who do know English is 
in my opinion remarkably small. Are you sure of the fact 
Ellen ?" 

" Why yes, Miss Alice." 

" Will you undertake to write me a note of two pages that 
shall not have one fault of grammar, nor one word spelt 
wrong, nor anything in it that is not good English ? You may 
take for a subject the history of this afternoon." 

" Yes ma'am, if you wish it. I hope I can write a note that 
long without making mistakes." 

Alice smiled. 

" I will not stop to inquire," she said, " whether that 
long is Latin or French ; but Ellen my dear, it is not English." 

Ellen blushed a little, though she laughed too. 

" I believe I have got into the way of saying that by hear- 
ing aunt Fortune and Mr. Van Brunt say it ; I don't think I 
ever did before I came here." 

" What are you so anxious to learn French for ?" 

" Mamma knows it, and I have often heard her talk French 
with a great many people ; and papa and I always wanted to 
be able to talk it too ; and mamma wanted me to learn it ; she 
said there were a great many French books I ought to read." 

" That last is true no doubt. Ellen I will make a bargain 
with you, — if you will study English with me I will study 
French with you." 







" Dear Miss Alice,' said Ellen caressing her,  I'll do it 
without that ; I'll study anything you please." 

" Dear Kllen I believe you would. But I should like to 
know it for my own sake ; we'll study it together ; we shall 
get along nicely I have no doubt ; we can learn to read it at 
least, and that is the main point." 

" But how shall we know what to call the words ?" said 
Ellen doubtfully. 

" That is a grave question," said Alice smiling. " I am 
afraid we should hit upon a style of pronunciation that a 
Frenchman would make nothing of. I have it !" she exclaimed clapping her hands, — " where there's a will there's a way, 
— it always happens so. Ellen, I have an old friend up on 
the mountain who will give us exactly what we want, unless 
I am greatly mistaken. We'll go and see her ; that is the 
very tiling ! — my old friend Mrs. Vawse." 

" Mrs. Vawse I" repeated Ellen ; — " not the grandmother 
of that Nancy Vawse?" 

" The very same. Her name is not Vawse, the eountry 
people call it so, and I being one of the country people have 
fallen into the way of it ; but her real name is Vosier. She 
was born a Swiss, and brought up in a wealthy French family, as the personal attendant of a young lady to whom she 
became exceedingly attached. This lady finally married an 
American gentleman ; and so great was Mrs. Vawse's love to 
her that she left country and family to follow her here. In 
a few years her mistress died ; she married ; and since that 
time she has been tossed from trouble to trouble ; — a perfect sea of troubles ; — till now she is left like a wreck upon 
this mountain top. A fine wreck she is ! I go to see her 
very often, and next time I will call for you, and we will propose our French plan ; nothing will please her better I know. 
By the way Ellen, are you as well versed in the other common branches of education as you are in your mother tongue ?" 

" What do you mean, Miss Alice ?" 

" Geography, for instance ; do you know it well ?" 

" Yes, ma'am ; I believe so ; I am sure I have studied it 
till I am sick of it." 

" Can you give me the boundaries of Great Thibet or 
Peru?" 

Ellen hesitated, 







"I had rather not try," she said, — "I am not sure. I 
can't remember those queer countries in Asia and South 
America half so well as Europe and North America." 

" Do you know anything about the surface of the country 
in Italy or France ; the character and condition of the people ; what kind of climate they have, and what grows there 
most freely ?" 

" Why no, ma'am," said Ellen ; " nobody ever taught 
me that." 

" Would you like to go over the Atlas again, talking about 
all these matters, as well as the mere outlines of the countries 
you have studied before ?" 

" Oh yes, dearly !" exclaimed Ellen. 

" Well, I think we may let Margery have the tea-things. 
But here is Captain's cake." 

" may I give him his supper !" said Ellen. 

" Certainly. You must carve it for him ; you know I told 
you he is very particular. Give him some of the egg too —
