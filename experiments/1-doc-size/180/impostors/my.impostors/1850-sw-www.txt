the hill, and the road did not yet allow them to turn their 
faces towards Mrs. Van Brunt's. A wearisome piece of 
the way this was, leading them from the place they 
wished to reach. They could not go fast either ; they 
were too weary and the walking too heavy. Captain had the 
best of it ; snug and quiet he lay wrapped in Alice's cloak 
and fast asleep, little wotting how tired his mistress's arms 
were. 

The path at length brought them to the long desired turning ; but it was by this time so dark that the fences on each 
side of the road showed but dimly. They had not spoken 
for a while ; as they turned the corner a sigh of mingled 
weariness and satisfaction escaped from Ellen's lips. It 
reached Alice's ear. 

" What's the matter love ?" said the sweet voice. No 
trace of weariness was allowed to come into it. 

" I am so glad we have got here at last," said Ellen, looking up with another sigh, and removing her hand for an instant from its grasp on the cloak to Alice's arm. 

" My poor child ! I wish I could cany you too. Can you 
hold on a little longer ?" 

" yes, dear Miss Alice ; I can hold on." 

But Ellen's voice was not so well guarded. It was like 
her steps, a little unsteady. She presently spoke again. 

" Miss Alice are you afraid ?" 

" I am afraid of your getting sick my child, and a little 
afraid of it for myself ; — of nothing else. What is there to 
be afraid of?" 

"It is very dark," said Ellen ; " and the storm is so thick, 
— do you think you can find the way ?" 







" I know it perfectly ; it is nothing but to keep straight 
on ; and the fences would prevent us from getting out of the 
road. It is hard walking I know, but we shall get there by- 
and-by ; bear up as well as you can dear. I am sorry I 
can give you no help but words. Don't you think a nice 
bright fire will look comfortable after all this ?" 

" O dear yes !" answered Ellen rather sadly. 

"Are you afraid Ellen?" 

"Tso, Miss Alice — not much — I don't like its being so 
dark, I can't see where I am going." 

" The darkness makes our way longer and more tedious ; it 
will do us no other harm love. I wish I had a hand to give 
you, but this great cat must have both of mine. The darkness and the light are both alike to our Father ; we are in 
his hand ; we are safe enough dear Ellen." 

Ellen's hand left the cloak again for an instant to press 
Alice's arm in answer ; voice failed at the minute. Then 
clinging anew as close to her side as she could get they toiled 
patiently on. The wind had somewhat lessened of its violence, and besides it blew not now in their faces, but against 
their backs, helping them on. Still the snow continued to 
fall very fast, and already lay thick upon the ground ; every 
half hour increased the heaviness and painfulness of their 
march ; and darkness gathered till the very fences could no 
longer be seen. Jt was pitch dark ; to hold the middle of 
the road was impossible ; their only way was to keep along by 
one of the fences ; and for fear of hurting themselves against 
some outstanding post or stone it was necessary to travel 
quite gently. They were indeed in no condition to travel 
otherwise if light had not been wanting. Slowly and patiently, with painful care groping their way, they pushed on through 
the snow and the thick night. Alice could feel the earnestness of Ellen's grasp upon her clothes ; and her close pressing 
up to her made their progress still slower and more difficult 
than it would otherwise have been. 

"Miss Alice," — said Ellen. 

" What, my child ?" 

" I wish you would speak to me once in a while." 
Alice freed one of her hands and took hold of Ellen's. 
"I have been so busy picking my way along, I have 
neglected you, haven't I ?" 







" no, ma'am. But I like to hear the sound of your voice 
sometimes, it makes me feel better." 

" This is an odd kind of traveling, isn't it ?" said Alice 
cheerfully ; — " in .the dark, and feeling our way along ? This 
will be quite an adventure to talk about, won't it?" 

" Quite," said Ellen. 

" It is easier going this way, don't you find it so ? The 
wind helps us forward." 

"It helps me too much," said Ellen ; " I wish it wouldn't 
be quite so very kind. Why, Miss Alice, I have enough to 
do to hold myself together sometimes. It almost makes me 
run, though I am so very tired." 

" Well it is better than having it in our faces at any rate. 
Tired you are, J know, and must be. We shall want to rest 
all day to-morrow, shan't we ?" 

" Oh I don't know !" said Ellen sighing ; " I shall be 
glad when we begin. How long do you think it will be, Miss 
Alice, before we get to Mrs. Van Brunt's ?" 

" My dear child I cannot tell you. I have not the least 
notion whereabouts we are. I can see no way marks, and I 
cannot judge at all of the rate at which we have come. 

" But what if we should have passed it in this darkness ?" 
said Ellen. 

" No, I don't think that," said Alice, though a cold doubt 
struck her mind at Ellen's words ; — " I think we shall 
see the glimmer of Mrs. Van Brunt's friendly candle by- 
and-by." 

But more uneasily and more keenly now she strove to see 
that glimmer through the darkness ; strove till the darkness 
seemed to press painfully upon her eyeballs, and she almost 
doubted her being able to see any light if light there were ; 
it was all blank thick darkness still. She began to question 
anxiously with herself which side of the house was Mrs. Van 
Brunt's ordinary sitting-room ; — whether she should see the 
light from it before or after passing the house ; and now her 
glance was directed often behind her, that they' might be sure 
in any case of not missing their desired haven. In vain she 
looked forward or back ; it was all one ; no cheering glimmer 
of lamp or candle greeted her straining eyes. Hurriedly now 
from time to time the comforting words were spoken to Ellen, 







for to pursue the long stretch of way that led onward from 
Mrs. Van Brunt's to Miss Fortune's would be a very serious 
matter ; Alice wanted comfort herself. 

" Shall we get there soon, do you think, Miss Alice ?" said 
poor Ellen, whose wearied feet carried her painfully over 
the deepening snow. The tone of voice went to Alice's heart. 

" [ don't know, my darling, — I hope so," she anwered, but 
it was spoken rather patiently than cheerfully. " Fear 
nothing, dear Ellen ; remember who has the care of us ; 
darkness and light are both alike to him ; nothing will do us 
any real harm." 

" How tired you must be, dear Miss Alice, carrying pussy !" 
Ellen said with a sigh. 

For the first time Alice echoed the sigh ; but almost imme- 
diately Ellen exclaimed in a totally different tone, " There's a 
light ! — but it isn't a candle — it is moving about ; — what is 
it ? what is it, Miss Alice ?" 

They stopped and looked. A light there certainly was, 
dimly seen, moving at some little distance from the fence on 
the opposite side of the road. All of a sudden it disappeared. 

* What is it?" whispered Ellen fearfully.
