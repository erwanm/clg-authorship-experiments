" Abraham did, we know ; why not Noah ? I do not 
mean, my boy, that he had a full knowledge of what we 
know; but that a dim, glorious persuasion of the promised 
deliverance possessed him, there can be no doubt. He was 
one of those who 'saw the promises afar off;' And he knew — 
nobody better — whether the world needed a deliverer. One 
destruction had just washed away one race of men; but it 
had not washed out sin; and of that he had proof enough 
in his own family." 

" Where did Shem go, uncle Sam ? He had other children 
besides the Jews, hadn't he ? " 

" Certainly. Shem occupied most of the western part of 
Asia. It almost seems as if both meanings of his name were 
prophetical The second meaning is ' to be put, or placed ;' 
and Shem's descendants had nothing of a roving or changeable spirit. They never spread themselves abroad like the 
sons of Japheth, and they were, and are, exactly what some 
country people call 'very set in their ways.' What they did 
two thousand, three thousand, ay, almost four thousand 
years ago, that they do still, even in very little matters. I 
shall tell you more of this by and by, as we go on. It is 
wonderful'' 




''To one of Japheth's children," said my grandmother, 
smiling. " Japheth was the Yankee of the family." 

"Surely he was," said uncle Sam. 

" Why, sir ? Now let us have Japhetk" 

"Japheth means 'extension;' and never was a truer 
prophecy than this name for him. He went to what the Bible 
calls ' the isles of the sea ; ' that is, the coast of the Mediterranean in Asia Minor and in Europe ; ' the isles of the Gentiles ' they are also called. From those, Japheth's descendants spread eastward into Asia, and northward into Europe, and 
lastly poured a flood of emigration westward into America. 
Do you see how the prophecy is fulfilled — ' God shall enlarge 
Japheth?'" 

"Why, yes, to be sure," said Dan. "I never understood 
that so well before. To be sure he was enlarged. Then, 
nnde Sam, that is not all How was he to 'dwell in the 
tents of Shemr" 

" What would you understand by dwelling in somebody's 
tent?" 

" Why, I should understand that I might share it, and 
have all the comfort and privileges of ?"

" Or you might understand," said liph, " driving the old 
owner out and taking possession for yourself." 

" It might be taken either way," said my uncle ; " and 
either way I think it is true. In Dan's sense, certainly. 
The Jews, that is, the children of Shem, had the revelation 
of the knowledge of God ; they had the covenants and the 
promises ; they alone, of all the peoples in the earth. Then 
Christ came, and they rejected Him; and then the despised Gtentiles, the children of Japheth, came into the blessing their brethren had thrown away. Japheth dwells in the 
tents of Shem ; he shares the shelter and comfort and privileges of them, as you said, Dan." 

"And how about my meaning?" said liph. 

" Why, Japheth seems to be taking possession literally in 
almost every part of the world. However, I am not sure 
but Shem will stay where he was 'placed.' We shall see 
more of that as we come to study the nations in detail 

 

Biun's children go down everywhere before the children of 
Japheth and Shem ; and always did.'' 

"I imagine Ham," said my grandmother, "to have been a 
selfish man ; sensuous, and loving his own ease and pleasure ; 
with a nature more acute for that than for more generous 
perceptions." 

" His descendants had plenty of ability," said uncle Sam ; 
"plenty of administrative power. They made great and 
magnificent nations." 

"I imagine he was just that," said my grandmother. 
" Superb and luxurious in his tastes, mental and bodily too ; 
loving the warm climes to which he went ; with abundance 
of natural gifts and love of power, but lacking the determined spirit and fire of Shem and Japheth to make good 
his gains." 

" Shem must have been a grand man ! " said my uncle. 
" I suppose he was a very perfect specimen. His descendants, some of them, are said to have the most perfect physical organisation of any people on the face of the earth. 
Shem, I should think, was a prouder man than either of the 
other two, in a personal way. Full of imagination and mental power, but full, too, of reverence for old things, and tenacious; holding to his opinions and purposes and habits. 
There was no rage after novelty in him. For taste, and 
keen perceptions, and quick intellects, I presume he was 
superior to both the others ; but he had that indomitable 
' stand-still ' quality, which kept him steady." 

" But we are the children of Japheth," said Priscilla. 

" Japheth was the Yankee of the family. He had not the 
strong power of association which characterised Shem, nor 
his reverence for old things. Japheth's propensity was to 
go forward and push discoveries and acquisitions in every 
line. He conquered territories and invented steam-engines 
and built ships and made railwa3rs ; while to this day the 
children of Shem are content with things as they are ; and 
too proud to make improvements." 

" It is very curious," said Prisdlla. 




" Do not the children of Shem find out any inventions, or 
do any great things ? " Liph asked. 

"None, in modem times — that I remember. They built 
great cities in the olden time ; and arts and learning to a 
great degree did flourish among them ; but very little of it 
did the rest of the world any good." 

" And what are the children of Ham doing ?" I asked. 

" Nothing, that I know of ; nothing better than smoking. 
Their day of magnificence has long passed away. They are 
a fallen race. Egypt is no better than the ' basest of kingdoms ' and all Africa seems waiting for her good time to 
come. But we shall know more about it, children, when we 
come to look into these matters more particularly." 



 



Sept. 10.— THE TOWER 

" Uncle Sam has got his pocket atlas along," whispered 
liph to me as we went to the woods on Monday. 

I was glad of it. But that was not the first business to be 
attended to. We were always a set of hungry people in the 
woods, 

" What do we talk about to-day, uncle Sam ? " I asked. 

" I know," said Liph. " The settling of the nations. That 
comes next." 

" Nations are not bom in a day," said uncle Sam. " We 
have got to follow the fortunes of the sons of Noah." 

" What do we know about their fortunes, sir ?— after they 
came out of the ark ? " 

" Well, a good deal," said my uncle. "In the first place, 
in due course of time, they came down from the high lands 
of Armenia, and settled in the warmer plains below. Perhaps Noah planted his vineyard at Nak-schivan, as the tradition goes, and lived there the rest of his long life. He 
lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years ; till he 
was nine hundred and fifty years old. By that time, and 
before, the families of his sons had multiplied into a good 
many people. But they did not at first separate from each 
other, any more than was needful or useful for the con- 
venience of pasturing their flocks and herds, and raising the 
necessary harvests of grain and fruit. The whole earth was 
of one language and one speech. They were all one great 
family, and naturally kept together; only growing and 
spreading along over the face of the country, as they multiplied from a few into a great many. We can tell pretty 
nearly, I think, what course some of them took. Let us look 
at the map. Up here, you see, is the valley of the Arazes 



and Nak-scMvan. It is written, ' they journeyed from 
the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar.' Now, if 
they had come down from Armenia over these southern hills, 
they would have found a plain a great deal sooner — up here 
in the northern parts of Mesopotamia. But if they came
