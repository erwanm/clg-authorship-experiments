nations a duty. And I found that my feelings 
were mixed about him. I discovered in him a 
conceit in regard to his long sojourn on this 
earth, as if it were somehow a credit to him. In 
the presence of his good opinion of himself, I 
could but question the real value of his continued 
life, to himself or to others. If he ever had any 
friends he had outlived them, except his boy ; 
his wives a century of them were all dead; 
the world had actually passed away for him. He 
hung on the tree like a frost-nipped apple, which 
the farmer has neglected to gather. The world 
always renews itself, and remains young. What 
relation had he to it ? 

I was delighted to find that this old man had 
never voted for George Washington. I do not 
know that he had ever heard of him. Washing 
ton may be said to have played his part since 
his time. I am not sure that he perfectly re- 



 

membered anything so recent as the American 
Revolution. He was living quietly in Ireland 
during our French and Indian wars, and he did 
not emigrate to this country till long after our 
revolutionary and our constitutional struggles 
were over. The Rebellion of '45 was the great 
event of the world for him, and of that he knew 
nothing. 

I intend no disrespect to this man, a cheer 
ful and pleasant enough old person, but he 
had evidently lived himself out of the world, as 
completely as people usually die out of it. His 
only remaining value was to the moralist, who 
might perchance make something out of him. 
I suppose if he had died young, he would have 
been regretted, and his friends would have la 
mented that he did not fill out his days in the 
world, and would very likely have called him back, 
if tears and prayers could have done so. They 
can see now what his prolonged life amounted to, 
and how the world has closed up the gap he once 
filled while he still lives in it. 

A great part of the unhappiness of this world 
consists in regret for those who depart, as it 



 

seems to us, prematurely. We imagine that if 
they would return, the old conditions would be 
restored. But would it be so ? If they, in any 
case, came back, would there be any place* for 
them ? The world so quickly readjusts itself 
after any loss, that the return of the departed 
would nearly always throw it, even the circle 
most interested, into confusion. Are the Enoch 
Ardens ever wanted ? 



II. 

A POPULAR notion akin to this, that the world 
would have any room for the departed if they 
should now and then return, is the constant regret that people will not learn by the experience 
of others, that one generation learns little from 
the preceding", and that youth never will adopt 
the experience of age. But if experience went for 
anything, we should all come to a stand-still ; for 
there is nothing so discouraging to effort. Disbelief in Ecclesiastes is the main-spring of action. 
In that lies the freshness and the interest of life, 
and it is the source of every endeavor. 



 

If the boy believed that the accumulation of 
wealth and the acquisition of power were what 
the old man says they are, the world would very 
soo be stagnant. If he believed that his chances 
of obtaining either were as poor as the majority 
of men find them to be, ambition would die 
within him. It is because he rejects the experi 
ence of those who have preceded him, that the 
world is kept in the topsy-turvy condition which 
we all rejoice in, and which we call progress. 

And yet I confess I have a soft place in my 
heart for that rare character in our New England 
life who is content with the world as he finds it, 
and who does not attempt to appropriate any 
more of it to himself than he absolutely needs 
from day to day. He knows from the beginning 
that the world could get on without him, and he 
has never had any anxiety to leave any result 
behind him, any legacy for the world to quarrel 
over. 

He is really an exotic in our New England 
climate and society, and his life is perpetually 
misunderstood by his neighbors, because he 
shares none of their uneasiness about getting on 



 

in life. He is even called lazy, good-for-nothing,' 
and "shiftless," the final stigma that we put 
upon a person who has learned to wait without 
the exhausting process of laboring. 

I made his acquaintance last summer in the 
country, -and I have not in a long time been so 
well pleased with any of our species. He was 
a man past middle life, with a large family. He 
had always been from boyhood of a contented 
and placid mind, slow in his movements, slow in 
his speech. I think he never cherished a hard 
feeling toward anybody, nor envied any one, least 
of all the rich and prosperous about whom he 
liked to talk. Indeed, his talk was a good deal 
about wealth, especially about his cousin who 
had been down South and " got fore-handed " 
within a few years. He was genuinely pleased 
at his relation's good luck, and pointed him out 
to me with some pride. But he had no envy of 
him, and he evinced no desire to imitate him. I 
inferred from all his conversation about "piling 
it up," (of which he spoke with a gleam of en 
thusiasm in his eye,) that there were moments 
when he would like to be rich himself; but it was 



 

evident that he would never make the least effort 
to be so, and I doubt if he could even overcome 
that delicious inertia of mind and body called 
laziness, sufficiently to inherit. 

Wealth seemed to have a far and peculiar 
fascination for him, and I suspect he was a 
visionary in the midst of his poverty. Yet I 
suppose he had hardly the personal property 
which the law exempts from execution. He had 
lived in a great many towns, moving from one 
to another with his growing family, by easy 
stages, and was always the poorest man in the 
town, and lived on the most niggardly of its 
rocky and bramble-grown farms, the productive 
ness of which he reduced to zero in a couple of 
seasons by his careful neglect of culture. The 
fences of his hired domain always fell into ruins 
under him, perhaps because he sat on them so 
much, and the hovels he occupied rotted down 
during his placid residence in them. He moved 
from desolation to desolation, but carried always 
with him the equal mind of a philosopher. Not 
even the occasional tart remarks of his wife, 
about their nomadic life and his serenity in the 


 

midst of discomfort, could ruffle his smooth 
spirit. 

He was, in every respect, a most worthy man, 
truthful, honest, temperate, and, I need not say,
