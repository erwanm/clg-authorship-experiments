had not cherished any particular desire, and 
thought of school-teaching. But one day the 
sense of knowledge came to her, the trend 
of her imagination, for she could hardly call 
it genius. 

" When the thought came to me, I went to 
work. If I could not have made it a success, 
I should have turned my attention to something 
else." 



 

" I do a good many things well," said Helen, 
with the fine absence of personal vanity. " Per 
haps, if I was poor, I could hit upon one that 
would earn me a living; but I have the far 
inward sense of not being a genius, and papa 
would object to anything beyond accomplish 
ments. So I must be a modern, fashionable 
girl," and she sighed. "There is a 'tea' on 
Thursday, and then I shall be fairly in the 
swim. And now tell me what you are doing." 

Thirza was glad to leave the other delicate 
subject. Helen pronounced the rooms charming, 
and spent such a long time over pictures and 
books that Thirza insisted upon her partaking 
of a dainty lunch, since the cold meat and 
fruit were right to her hand. 

" It is so cosy and delightful that I quite envy 
the other women," she said, as she went away. 

Thirza sat a long while afterward, lost in 
thought. She had riot meant specially to in 
fluence Helen Otis. Her life was best for her 
self, and yet it did seem as if most women were 
better content in marriage. Surely the army of 
workers from necessity was large enough. One 
really had to push into the avenues of employ 
ment. 

She put on her best black silk and her finest 
laces for the Otis dinner, though Helen had 





promised they would have it all to themselves. 
Mrs. Otis was not like any of her vague expec 
tations. A woman medium in size, in looks, 
with nothing especial to distinguish her except 
a serene sweetness and a large share of common 
sense, that grew upon you and soon convinced 
you of her sterling worth. She was delicate and 
intelligent, well bred rather than high bred, and 
it seemed to Thirza that she was "fulfilled of 
all womanliness." She was won almost against 
her will. 

Mr. Otis had been detained and was a little 
late, apologizing courteously. A still handsome 
man, inclining now to stoutness, full of pleasant 
society courtesies, that oil the machinery of liv 
ing if they have no deep underbreadth. He 
was deeply in love with his wife, it was plain 
to be seen, and Thirza realized how hard it was 
for his only daughter to be set aside, to be 
treated as a pretty kitten or plaything, as if she 
had not really outgrown childhood, when to 
every one else she was a dignified young woman. 
But Helen herself did not suspect that a year 
or so ago she had appealed to him in just this 
manner, and he had been too much engrossed 
in his new love to note the change. The added 
dignity on Helen's part held her aloof with a 
certain pride. 





At their marriage, Mr. Otis had said : " A 
stepmother to a grown-up girl is an ungracious 
office, and of course Helen feels she could have 
kept my house and done everything for me, 
in the intervals of having lovers and getting 
married herself. It would have been too much 
to ask of any young girl. And I want compan 
ionship, not merely girlish prattle ; a love to 
gladden my coming years, selfish fellow that I 
am, not something to give away just as I am 
becoming accustomed to it. But I can trust you 
to be patient with her. It will all come around 
right in time." 

Mrs. Otis had not promised with her lips 
merely. She soon saw the cause of the inhar- 
mony that would never be patent to the world, 
for Helen was too proud to admit the slightest 
cause of disquiet. She resolved to win her step 
daughter's love even if it should take years. 

" Of course you hear from Westhorpe," Helen 
said, as Thirza was putting on her wraps and 
pinning her hat, while Helen hovered about her. 

" Oh, yes ; the new railroad progresses, and a 
large silk factory is to be taken out there, just 
across the river. I believe Mr. Kent is afraid of 
their setting up a rival town, my sister wrote." 

And as Clara was occupied mostly with herself 
and John, she had said not a word about the 



 

Palmers, as they had not come to the tragedy. 
Helen longed to ask, but did not. She clung curi 
ously to Thirza, because she was a part of the 
summer's life of something that would never 
come again. She ran in one morning during the 
next week. There was a curious lightness in her 
voice, a satisfaction in her whole air. 

" I want to tell you what a wonderful impres 
sion you made upon Mrs. Otis. She considers 
you quite a heroine. And papa hopes you will 
have the good sense to keep out of the strong- 
minded ranks. He is so bitterly opposed to the 
emancipation of women that, you see, I have not 
had the courage to admit your bearing that way. 
He classes them all with a few he has happened 
to meet. Yet he is compelled to admit that busi 
ness women are reliable. Oh, are you ill ? You 
look so pale and distraught. Forgive my heed- 
lessness ! " 

A letter lay on the table. Thirza's eyes went 
down to it, then up to Helen. " You will be sorry 
to hear," she began abruptly, "I don't know 
that I can tell it. Read, here." She gave one of 
the sheets to Helen. 

" Oh, how dreadful ! Poor dear Aunt Hannah ! 
I came to admire and appreciate her fully. If 
she was rather narrow according to later lights, 
she had so much good sense and kindliness. And 



 

that it should happen this way. Do you suppose 
it was Bessie's carelessness ? I was interested in 
her at first, but she is vain and pretentious and has 
a strand of ingratitude." 

Helen shuddered, thinking of that last talk. 
" What will she do now ? " she inquired, with a 
curious huskiness in her voice. 

"This is what she has done, or what he has 
done. It is the best, perhaps the only step," 
and she handed Helen another sheet. 

" Do you mean can you think it best for 
Royal Palmer?" Helen inquired, with rising in 
dignation, that sent a warm color from forehead 
to chin. " Do you think he loved her ? " 

" Not in either your or my understanding of the 
word, perhaps. There are many kinds of love, 
it seems to me, and men make themselves more
