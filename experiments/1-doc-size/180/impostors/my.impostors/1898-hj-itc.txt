still and cold as any one when that was the 
sole solution. 

Yet, more than any contact hitherto 
achieved, these counted instants struck her 
as marking a step : they were built so just 
in the mere flash on the recognition of his 
now definitely knowing what it was she 
would do for him. The anything, any 
thing she had uttered in the Park went to 
and fro between them and under the poked- 
out chins that interposed. It had all at last 
even put on the air of their not needing now 
clumsily to manoeuvre to converse: their 
former little postal make-believes, the 
intense implications of questions and 
answers and change, had become in the 
light of the personal fact, of their having 
had their moment, a possibility compara 
tively poor. It was as if they had met for 
all time it exerted on their being in pres 
ence again an influence so prodigious. 
When she watched herself, in the memory 
of that night, walk away from him as if she 
were making an end, she found something 





too pitiful in the primness of such a gait. 
Hadn't she precisely established on the part 
of each a consciousness that could end only 
with death? 

It must be admitted, that, in spite of this 
brave margin, an irritation, after he had 
gone, remained with her; a sense that 
presently became one with a still sharper 
hatred of Mr. Buckton, who, on her friend 's 
withdrawal, had retired with the telegrams 
to the sounder and left her the other work. 
She knew indeed she should have a chance 
to see them, when she would, on file; and 
she was divided, as the day went on, between 
the two impressions of all that was lost and 
all that was reasserted. What beset her 
above all, and as she had almost never 
known it before, was the desire to bound 
straight out, to overtake the autumn after 
noon before it passed away for ever and 
hurry off to the Park and perhaps be with 
him there again on a bench. It became, 
for an hour, a fantastic vision with her that 
he might just have gone to sit and wait for 





her. She could almost hear him, through 
the tick of the sounder, scatter with his stick, 
in his impatience, the fallen leaves of 
October. Why should such a vision seize 
her at this particular moment with such a 
shake? There was a time from four to 
five when she could have cried with happi 
ness and rage. 

Business quickened, it seemed, toward 
five, as if the town did wake up; she had 
therefore more to do, and she went through 
it with little sharp stampings and jerkings: 
she made the crisp postal-orders fairly snap 
while she breathed to herself : It 's the last 
day the last day! The last day of what? 
She couldn't have told. All she knew now 
was that if she were out of the cage she 
wouldn't in the least have minded, this time, 
its not yet being dark. She would have 
gone straight toward Park Chambers and 
have hung about there till no matter when. 
She would have waited, stayed, rung, asked, 
have gone in, sat on the stairs. What the 
day was the last of was probably, to her 





strained inner sense, the group of golden 
ones, of any occasion for seeing the hazy 
sunshine slant at that angle into the smelly 
shop, of any range of chances for his wish 
ing still to repeat to her the two words 
that, in the Park, she had scarcely let him 
bring out. See here see here ! the sound 
of these two words had been with her per 
petually ; but it was in her ears to-day with 
out mercy, with a loudness that grew and 
grew. What was it they then expressed? 
what was it he had wanted her to see? She 
seemed, whatever it was, perfectly to see it 
now to see that if she should just chuck 
the whole thing, should have a great and 
beautiful courage, he would somehow make 
everything up to her. When the clock 
struck five she was on the very point of say 
ing to Mr. Buckton that she was deadly ill 
and rapidly getting worse. This announce 
ment was on her lips, and she had quite 
composed the pale, hard face she would 
offer him: I can't stop I must go home. 
If I feel better, later on, I ll come back. 





I'm very sorry, but I must go. At that 
instant Captain Everard once more stood 
there, producing in her agitated spirit, by 
his real presence, the strangest, quickest 
revolution. He stopped her off without 
knowing it, and by the time he had been a 
minute in the shop she felt that she was 
saved. 

That was from the first minute what she 
called it to herself. There were again other 
persons with whom she was occupied, and 
again the situation could only be expressed 
by their silence. It was expressed, in fact, 
in a larger phrase than ever yet, for her eyes 
now spoke to him with a kind of supplica 
tion. Be quiet, be quiet! they pleaded; 
and they saw his own reply: I ll do what 
ever you say; I won't even look at you 
see, see! They kept conveying thus, with 
the friendliest liberality, that they wouldn't 
look, quite positively wouldn t. What she 
was to see was that he hovered at the other 
end of the counter, Mr. Buckton 's end, 
surrendered himself again to that frustra- 





tion. It quickly proved so great indeed that 
what she was to see further was how he 
turned away before he was attended to, and 
hung off, waiting, smoking, looking about 
the shop; how he went over to Mr. Cocker 's 
own counter and appeared to price things, 
gave in fact presently two or three orders 
and put down money, stood there a long 
time with his back to her, considerately 
abstaining from any glance round to see if 
she were free. It at last came to pass in 
this way that he had remained in the shop 
longer that she had ever yet known him to 
do, and that, nevertheless, when he did turn 
about she could see him time himself she 
was freshly taken up and cross straight to 
her postal subordinate, whom some one 
else had released. He had in his hand all 
this while neither letters nor telegrams, and 
now that he was close to her for she was 
close to the counter-clerk it brought her 
heart into her mouth merely to see him look 
at her neighbor and open his lips. She was 
too nervous to bear it. He asked for a Post-
