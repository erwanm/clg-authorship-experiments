out/’ with a chuckle. ‘‘Ye see, I haven’t come to 
beggin’ yet.” 

“ But you must let me help a little when you are 
doing such a kindly deed. Miry’s a nice, clever 
woman, and ought to have a good home.” 

“ She’ll have enough to eat and be kept warm, 
I can promise ye that, and wife’ll be glad of her 
help.” 

Dan went up in the garret and they took down 
the bedstead, bundled up the bed and two com- 
fortables, and packed them on the sleigh. There 
was the old Boston rocker with its faded cover, 
and some chairs, and various little odds and ends. 
The strip of carpet they should not need, and he 
was profuse in his thanks. She did not want to 
take the money, but he insisted. Then she found 
some clothes of Aunt Kitty’s, and Prim divided the 
stockings. 

“ Well, they’ll think I’ve struck ile somewhere 
when I drive up with this load of things. I’m so 
obleeged that I raily haven’t any words to put it 
in. An’ I hope you’ll have the best of luck. Mis’ 
Firth, with that new man of yourn — you deserve it 
— an’ that the childern’ll have a good father.” 

“ Thank you. And you deserve some good for- 
tune for trying to make a poor body happy. The 
Reeds haven’t the name of being very generous. 



and the talk is that they have worked her pretty 
hard. Some day I will stop and see you, and re- 
member me to your wife.” 

Thank’ee, I will. She’ll be glad enough to see 

ye.” 

He kept looking back and nodding until he was 
quite up the lane. 


CHAPTER VI 


TREASURES TO GIVE AND TO KEEP 

Mr. Yates drove off with a light heart. Now 
they really were dismantling the house. 

It's very funny,” began Prim, who had been 
bustling around. And we've had a vandue after 
all.” 

Not exactly,” said her mother. “ There was no 
bidding. It was a great surprise, though. And 
I am glad Almira Pierson will not need to end her 
days in the poorhouse. Mr. Yates ought to have 
some prosperity for so kindly a deed, and I know 
they will be good to her.” 


I think I'll drive over home now and come for 
you — say about three ? ” proposed Dan. 

Yes; if the Bachmans come at all they will be 
here soon, and we shall be mostly packed up.” 

I'm hungry,” said Goldie. “ And there comes 
Tabby from the chicken yard. Why, I've hardly 
thought of her. My prosperity is making me for- 
getful,” in a droll tone. 

Tabby was very glad to see them, and wanted 

to get in Goldie's lap, one of her favorite places. 



Prim poured out the coffee they had brought, 
and set it on the stove to heat while she spread out 
the luncheon. Mrs. Mann was feeling rather tired, 
and was glad of a little rest. The big chest was 
packed nearly full, and really there was quite a 
clearing. 

They were still sitting about the stove when they 
heard steps on the doorstone, and a knock. Mari- 
gold opened it as her mother rose. It was Mr. 
and Mrs. Bachman. 

“ Oh, we were afraid we would be late,” said 
the bright- faced wife, “ but there was some work 
to get off, and the man was behind. You must 
forgive us. Oh, what a fine large room! And 
how warm the stove makes it I Why, we shall be 
lost,” turning to her husband with a beam- 
ing smile. We have been so crowded, you 
know.” 

And there are two more rooms and a big gar- 
ret. Why, nine of us lived here, and Tabby. Oh, 
I hope you will want Tabby. We cannot take her 
on account of the dogs. And if some rats should 
come to the chicken house, she will be sure to catch 
them.” 

I am most fond of a cat, and we shall be glad 
to have her,” returned Mr. Bachman. And the 
place will be so nice.” 




Here are the bedrooms,” explained Mai'igold, 
and here is the woodshed, where you can wash in 
summer, and in winter you let the water in the 
pump run down, so it will not freeze, and after 
you have pumped awhile it comes back. Here you 
go upstairs,” and she led the way. 

“ Oh, it is so fine and large, and in summer such 
beautiful trees ! Oh, husband, it will seem like the 
old home! ” with a kind of rapture in her voice. 
She spoke with quite an accent, but it sounded 
pretty. 

Yes, yes,” he returned. The Graus were 
very kind to us, lady, and helped put us on our 
feet, and they have prospered, so why should not 
we? ” 

“ Oh, yes. And the garden and chickens I My 
fingers have ached to have a garden. They gave 
us some vegetables, but Mr. Grau liked to do all 
the gardening himself. But at home I did it, and 
the flowers I You people do not seem to care for 
flowers.” 

We used to, but when Mr. Firth was gone 
there was so much to look after, and sewing for 
the children.” 

‘'Ach! That is so. We have but two, but 
now they will begin to help, besides going to school. 
And you cannot think of all the gladness that will 


be mine when I come here to live,” and her eyes 
shone with delight. 

“ We will have the place cleaned up and a good 
coat of whitewash put on when this rubbish is 
cleared away. We do not mean to take much of 
it. It is old and worn — if there is anything that 
would do you any good ” 

“ Oh, we have saved out a little to buy things 
when we had a better home.” 

“ But I do not mean that,” Mrs. Mann inter- 
posed quickly. Some have already gone away; 
they are not worth buying ; but you would be wel- 
come to them while they last.” 

Oh, you are too good in the matter. No, 
you must let us pay as we can, and we will be 
glad of the waiting-time until we can get turned 
about.” 

Mr. Bachman had been out with Linn inspecting 
the garden, the trees, and the chicken-house, that 
the boy had patched up many a time. They had 
trudged through the snowy paths, but his face was 
alight with satisfaction.
