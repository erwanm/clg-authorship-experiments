perhaps because they knew Dr. Kinnard better. Nelly 
was twenty now ; and, though the engagement had been 
of but six months' duration, the wedding-day was already 
appointed. She was not a romantic girl ; and this made 
her choice appear the more peculiar to me. 

" Well, I hope you will be very happy," I said pres 
ently, "and that the children will not prove too much 
for you. If j-ou could have them alone" 

"That has troubled me, I must confess;" and a per 
plexed line crossed Nelly's fair brow. " If I could have 
just them and their father ! though, Rose, I must admit 
that they are not entrancing specimens of childhood. 
Maud is tall for her age, slender and sallow, with straight 
light brown hair, and light hazel eyes, and the oddest, 
pursed-up mouth, what we would call a regular little 
prink. Bertie has beautiful dark brown eyes, like his 
father, and dark hair that curls a little ; but there is a 
kind of obstinacy in his face that I dread somewhat, 
though he is more inclined to be jolly, I think. But you 
see their aunt has always had charge of them, and pro 
poses now to become their governess, as she has some 
peculiar views about education. She is their only relative 
on their mother's side." 

" And, of course, she must live with you?" 

"I must live with her;" and Nelly made a humorous 
grimace. "She was older than her sister, and must be 
nearly forty. Then the doctor's mother is past sixty. 
Rose, do you remember how we used to wish that we had 
a grandmother?" 

Oh, that grandmother ! How we had talked about her 




in our childish days ! the very dearest old woman in the 
world, rather small, but straight and brisk and bright; 
with a lovely, soft, wrinkled complexion, white as milk ; 
blue eyes that*were tender and merry, and with the pecu 
liar content you sometimes see in eyes that have used their 
time and privileges well, as if they had seen much, and 
remembered -a great deal, and could relate chapters of 
those wonderful bits and fragments of things that hap 
pened " when I was young." Her hair was to be silvery, 
and she was to wear caps with full lace borders around her 
sweet face. Her dresses were to be soft gra}"s and browns, 
raw silk, I think the Quaker material is called. Mamma 
had a little square shawl in the identical stuff', laid away 
in a drawer, which had once been her grandmother's. 
How many pictures we drew of this dear, charming old 
lady, sitting in her rocking-chair, knitting, and telling us 
stories ! Only we could never quite decide whether she 
was papa's mother, or mamma's mother. I smiled now 
to think of it. 

" And how we envied other girls' grandmothers ! But 
we made ours to order ; and I shall have to take Grandma 
Kinnard just as she is." 

"Do you think you shall like her?" I asked rather 
timidly, glancing up. 

"She sets all my ideas at defiance," returned Nelly 
with an odd smile. " Her eyes are very black, and her 
face is long and thin. She wears no caps, or aprons, or 
little neckerchiefs crossed over her bosom, but ruffles and 
overskirts and chignons, and is very, very modern. O 
Rose ! when we grow old, let us accept the fact gracefully. 
You can't think how disappointed I was when I saw her."' 

" Nelly, I wonder at your courage. It is not a lova 
ble household. You cannot even deceive yourself on the 
subject." 

" Nor do I desire to, Eose. Mamma says the part of 
true wisdom is to look at facts as they are, and then do 





the best. Fann} r had no trouble ; yet she went into a 
household of clderlj* people." 

" But they all liked her so beforehand, and wanted her 
to come. And the Churchills were lovety people." 

" It seems to me that more attention ought to be paid 
to the relatives on both sides than is commonly done. 
Why should we make up our minds that we are going to 
dislike each other, and, instead of commencing with the 
graceful and tender courtesies of life, bristle all over with 
thorns, and command every one to keep at a distance ? 
There is not even Christian charity in it." 

" We cannot alwaj's love people to order, as you said 
yourself." 

" True enough. I do not expect any wonderful wel 
come. Indeed, I fancy that both ladies would rather go 
on in their own way ; but, after having fulfilled all past 
trusts, Dr. Kinnard surety has some right to happiness. 
Neither of these women is dependent on him. And 
we love each other ! I know you think it absurd of me, 
Rose," she cries in a sort of defiant way, as if it would 
hardly be safe for me to say so. 

"I suppose }x>u have the right of choice;" and I 
smile. 

"Thank you ! " With that she makes a stately 
courtesy. 

" How they will miss you at home ! " I say presently. 

" But there are four left ; and Daisy is almost eighteen. 
Think of it ! O Rose, what a dear old home it has been 
for all ! A crowded country rectory, a clergj'man ' pass 
ing rich ' on his thousand a year, and seven girls ! But 
with it all, the best and sweetest mother in the whole 
world. It does seem ungrateful to go away ; but it is the 
fashion of this world." 

The tears glistened in her eyes a moment ; but she 
laughed them away. 

" To think of being sentimental over your parents, 



 

V 

ingtead of your lover ! But, Rose, I must be up and 
doing. Since, like Benedick, I do purpose marriage, I 
will think of nothing the world can say against it. When 
are we to shop? For there is only a month, you know." 

As I was in the city, right in the midst of every thing, 
with Mrs. Whitcomb for my " right-hand man," Nelly 
had come to me to help her plan and arrange her bridal 
outfit. 

When Fanny and I (the two elder daughters) were 
married, there had been very plain and inexpensive 
trousseaus. As papa said with his fine discrimination, 
we were married from our station, not from our lovers'. 
Since that period, however, matters had gone on quite 
prosperously in the old home-nest. 

Fan had married into one of the oldest and wealthiest 
families in Wachusett. Her husband's uncle and aunt 
had adopted them. Winthrop Ogden had come home to 
live, and was already looked upon as a young man who 
would make his mark. He was connected with the bank, 
and was taking a warm interest in local politics ; and some 
of the stead}* -going old men predicted a brilliant future 
for him. 

Mrs. Ogden was quite a lady, and rode in her carriage, 
had a nurse for her children, and numerous indulgences 
of which her mother had never dreamed. More than one 
of the belles in town who thought themselves quite above 
her then, envied her now. But prosperity agreed with 
her. She was the same bright, joyous, Avarm-hearted 
Fan who had brightened the quaint old rectory. 

So, when this third marriage was settled, she one day 
slipped a crisp little roll in Nelly's hand. 

"That is for some wedding-finery, my dear," she said 
gayly. " I told Winthrop that he might do the ornamen 
tal part, silver and gold, and all that, but that I should 
be strictly useful."
