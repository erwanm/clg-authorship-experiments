long to the ravens of the spirit. Two years are 
not eternity, and in happiness the past rolls together like a scroll and is naught. She fell to 
dreaming. Her lips that had been set with the 
gravity of stone relaxed in warm curves. The 
color came back to her cheek, the light to her eyes. 
She was a girl at her grating with the roses poignant above her, and the world, radiant, alluring, 
and all for her, swimming in the violet haze 
beyond. 



Eezanov in those days was literally lord and 
master at the Presidio. If he did not bum the 
house of his devoted host he ran it to suit himself. He turned one of its rooms into an office, 
where he received the envoys from the different 
Missions and examined the samples of everything 
submitted to him, trusting little to his commissary. His leisure he employed scouring the coun- 
try or shooting deer and quail in the company 
of his younger hosts. The literal mind of Don 
Jose accepted him as an actual son and embryonic 
Califomian, and, his conscience at peace, revelled 
in his society as a sign from propitiated heaven ; 
rejoicing in the virtue of his years. The Governor, testily remarking that as California was so 
well governed for the present he would retire to 
Monterey and take a siesta, rode off one morning, 
but not without an affectionate: " God preserve 
the life of your excellency many years.'' 

But although Eezanov saw the most sanguine 
hopes that had brought him to California fulfilled, 
and although he looked from the mountain ridges 




of the east over the great low valleys watered by 
rivers and shaded by oaks, where enough grain 
could be raised to keep the blood red in a thousand 
times the colonial population of Eussia, although 
he felt himself in more and more abundant health, 
more and more in love with life, it is not to be 
supposed for a moment that he was satisfied. 
Concha he barely saw. She remained with the 
Moragas, and although she came occasionally to 
the afternoon dances at the Presidio, and he had 
dined once at her cousin's house, where the formal 
betrothal had taken place and the marriage contract had been signed in the presence of her 
family and more intimate friends, the priests, 
his officers, and the Governor, he had not 
spoken with her for a moment alone. Nor had 
her eyes met his in a glance of understanding. 
At the dances she showed him no favor; and 
as the engagement was to be as secret as 
might be in that small community, until his 
return with consent of Pope and King, he was 
forced to concede that her conduct was irreproachable ; but when on the day of the betrothal she was 
oblivious to his efforts to draw her into the garden, he mounted his horse and rode off in a huff. 
The truth was that Concha liked the present 



 

arrangement no better than himself, and knowing 
that her own appeal against the proprieties would 
result in a deeper seclusion, she determined to 
goad him into using every resource of address and 
subtlety to bring about a more human state of 
affairs. And she accomplished her object. Eezanov, at the end of a week, was not only infuriated but alarmed. He knew the imagination of 
woman, and guessed that Concha, in her brooding 
solitude, distorted all that was unfortunate in the 
present and dwelt morbidly on the future. He 
knew that she must resent his part in the long 
separation, no doubt his lack of impulsiveness in 
not proposing elopement. There was a priest in 
his company who, although he ate below the salt 
and found his associates among the sailors, could 
have performed the ceremony of marriage when 
the Juno, under full sail in the night, was scudding for the Eussian north. It is not to be denied 
that this romantic alternative appealed to Eezanov, and had it not been for the starving wretches 
so eagerly awaiting his coming he might have 
been tempted to throw commercial relations to 
the winds and flee with his bride while San Fran- 
cisco, secure in the knowledge of the Juno's 
empty hold, was in its first heavy sleep. It is 




doubtful if he would have advanced beyond impulse, for Eezanov was not the man to lose sight 
of a purpose to which he had set the full strength 
of his talents, and life had tempered his impetuous 
nature with much philosophy. Moreover, while 
his conscience might ignore the double dealing 
necessary to the accomplishment of patriotic or 
political acts, it revolted at the idea of outwitting, possibly wrecking, his trusting and hospi- 
table host. But the mere fact that his imagination 
could dwell upon such an issue as reckless flight, 
inflamed his impatience, and his desire to see 
Concha daily during these last few weeks of 
propinquity. Finally he sought the cooperation 
of Father Abella, and that wise student of maids 
and men gave him cheer. 

On Thursday afternoon there was to take place 
the long delayed Indian dance and bull-bear fight; 
not in the Presidio, but at the Mission, the pride 
of the friars inciting them to succeed where the 
military authorities had failed. All the little 
world of San Francisco would be there, and it 
would be strange if in the confusion between performance and supper a lover could not find a 
moment alone with his lady. 

The elements were kind to the padres. The 




afternoon was not too liot, although the sun 
flooded the plain and there was not a cloud on 
the dazzling blue of the sky. Never had the Mission and the mansions looked so white, their tiles 
so red. The trees were blossoming pink and white 
in the orchards, the lightest breeze rippled the 
green of the fields; and into this valley came 
neither the winds nor the fogs of the ocean. 

The priests and their guests of honor sat on 
the long corridor beside the church; the soldiers, 
sailors and Indians of Presidio and Mission form- 
ing the other three sides of a hollow square. The 
Indian women were a blaze of color. The ladies 
on the corridor wore their mantillas, jewels, and 
the gayest of artificial flowers. There were as 
many fans as women. Eezanov sat between 
Father Abella and the Comandante, and not 
being in the best of tempers had never looked 
more imposing and remote. Concha, leaning 
against one of the pillars, stole a glance at him 
and wondered miserably if this haughty European had really sought her hand, if it were not a 
girls foolish dream. But Concha's humble moments at this period of her life were rare, and she 
drew herself up proudly, the blood of the proudest 
race in Europe shaking angrily in her veins. 




A moment later, in response to a power greater 
than any within herself, she turned again. The 
attention of hosts and gnests was riveted upon 
the preliminary antics of the Indian dancers, and 
Eezanov seized the opportunity to lean forward 
unobserved and gaze at the girl whom it seemed 
to him he saw for the first time in the full splendor of her beauty. She wore a large mantilla of 
white Spanish lace. In the fashion of the day it 
rose at the back almost from the hem of her gown 
to descend in a point over the high comb to her 
eyes. The two points of the width were gathered 
at her breast, defining the outlines of her superb 
figure, and fastened with one large Castilian rose 
surrounded by its mass of tiny sharp buds and dull 
green leaves. As the familiar scent assailed Eez- 
anov's nostrils they tingled and expanded. His 
lids were lifted and his eyes glowing as he finally 
compelled her glance, and her own eyes opened 
with an eager flash ; her lips parted and her shoulders lost their haughty poise. For a moment their 
gaze lingered in a perfect understanding; his ill- 
humor vanished, and he leaned back with a complimentary remark as Father Abella directed his 
attention to the most agile of the Indians. 
The swart natives of both sexes with their thick 




features and long hair were even more hideous 
than usual in bandeaux of bright feathers, scant 
garments made from the breasts of water-fowls, 
rattling strings of shells, and tattooing on arm 
and leg no longer concealed by the decorous Mission smock. Eezanov had that day sent them 
presents of glass beads and ribbons, and in these 
they took such extravagant pride that for some
