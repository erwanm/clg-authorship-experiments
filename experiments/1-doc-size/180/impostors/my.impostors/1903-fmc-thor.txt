palace. But I did not know that he had been here 
yesterday afternoon. I live in the Via Ludovisi and 
had just come here on business, when you knocked." 

He was very affable now, and explained the porter's 
absence, and the fact that a gentleman who had lived 
in the house, but had left it, had accidentally taken his 
key with him, so that it was necessary to get a work- 
man to open the door. 

"And it is as well that you should be here," he 
added, " for the big man of whom the cabman spoke 
may be the servant of that gentleman. I remember 
seeing him once, and I noticed that he was unusually 
big. He may have been here yesterday after his 
master left, and we may find some clue in the apartment." 

" Excellent ! " said the detective, rubbing his hands. 

He was particularly fond of cases in which doors 
had to be opened by force, and understood that part 
of his business thoroughly. 

The key turned in the lock of the postern, and the 





porter entered, bringing Gigi with him. They both 
started and turned pale when they saw the policeman 
and the detective. 

" At what time did Signor Malipieri send you out 
on that errand yesterday afternoon?" asked Volterra, 
looking hard at the porter. 

The old man drew himself up, wiped his forehead 
with a blue cotton handkerchief, and looked from the 
Baron to the detective, trying to make out whether his 
employer wished him to speak the truth. A moment's 
reflection told him that he had better do so, as the 
visit of the police must be connected with the stain of 
blood he had washed from the pavement, and he could 
prove that he had nothing to do with it. 

" It was about five o'clock," he answered quietly. 

" And when did you come back ? " enquired the 
detective. 

" It was dusk. It was after Ave Maria, for I heard 
the bells ringing before I got here." 

"And you did not notice the blood on the stones 
when you came in, because it was dusk, I suppose," 
said the detective, assuming a knowing smile, as if he 
had caught the man. 

" I saw it this morning," answered the porter with- 
out hesitation, "and I washed it away." 

" You should have called the police," said the other 
severely. 

"Should I, sir?" The porter affected great politeness all at once. "You will excuse my ignorance." 

" We are wasting time,'" Volterra said to the detective. "The porter knows nothing about it. Let 
us go upstairs." 

He led the way, and the others followed, including 
Gigi, who carried a leathern bag containing a few 
tools. 

" It is of no use to ring again," observed Volterra. 
" There cannot be anybody in the apartment, and this 
is my own house. Open that door for us, my man, 
and do as little damage as you can." 

Gigi looked at the patent lock. 

" I cannot pick that, sir," he said. " The gentle- 
man made me put it on for him, and it is one of those 
American patent locks." 

" Break it, then," Volterra answered. 

Gigi selected a strong chisel, and inserted the blade 
in the crack of the door, on a level with the brass disk. 
He found the steel bolt easily. 

" Take care," he said to the Baron, who was nearest 
to him and drew back to give him room to swing his 
hammer. 

He struck three heavy blows, and the door flew open 
at the third. The detective had looked at his watch, 
for it was his business to note the hour at which any 
forcible entrance was made. It was twenty minutes 
to nine. Malipieri and Sabina had slept a little more 
than five hours and a half. 

Malipieri, still sleeping heavily in his armchair, 
heard the noise in a dream. He fancied he was in the 
vaults again, driving his crowbar into the bricks, and 
that he suddenly heard Masin working from the other 





side. But Masin was not alone, for there were voices, 
and he had several people with him. 

Malipieri awoke with a violent start. Volterra, the 
detective, the two police soldiers, Gigi and the porter 
were all in the study, looking at him as he sat there in 
his armchair, in the broad light, carefully dressed as if 
he had been about to go out when he had sat down. 

" You sleep soundly, Signor Malipieri," said the fat 
Baron, with a caressing smile. 

Malipieri had good nerves, but for a moment he was 
dazed, and then, perhaps for the first time in his life, he 
was thoroughly frightened, for he knew that Sabina 
must be still asleep in his room, and in spite of his 
urgent request when he had left her, he did not believe 
that she had locked the door after all. The first thought 
that flashed upon him was that Volterra had somehow 
discovered that she was there, and had come to find her. 
There were six men in the room ; he guessed that the 
Baron was one of those people who carry revolvers 
about with them, and two of the others were police 
soldiers, also armed with revolvers. He was evidently 
at their mercy. Short of throwing at least three of the 
party out of the window, nothing could avail. Such 
things are done without an effort on the stage by the 
merest wisp of a man, but in real life one must be a 
Hercules or a gladiator even to attempt them. Malipieri 
thought of what Sabina had said in the vault. Had 
any two people ever been in such a situation before ? 

For one instant, his heart stood still, and he passed 
his hand over his eyes. 



 

" Excuse me," lie said then, quite naturally. " I had 
dressed to go to your house this morning, and I fell 
asleep in my chair while waiting till it should be time. 
How did you get in ? And why have you brought 
these people with you ? " 

He was perfectly cool now, and the Baron regretted 
that he had made a forcible entrance. 

" I must really apologize," he answered. " The porter 
rang yesterday evening, several times, and again this 
morning, but could get no answer, and as you had told 
me that you were going to change your quarters, we 
supposed that you had left and had accidentally taken 
the key with you." 

Malipieri did not believe a word of what he said, but 
the tone was very apologetic. 

" The cellars are flooded," said the porter, speaking 
over Volterra's shoulder. 

" I know it," Malipieri answered. " I was going to 
inform you of that this morning," he continued, speak- 
ing to the Baron. " I do not think that the police are 
necessary to our conversation," he added, smiling at the 
detective. 

" I beg your pardon, sir," answered the latter, " but 
we are here to ask if you know anything of a grave
