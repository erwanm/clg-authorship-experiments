“I am sorry to disturb your enjoyment,” said the teacher; “but duty
before pleasure, you know. I will only suggest that, as our young friend
here depends on his violin for support, we ought to collect a little
money for him. James Reynolds, suppose you pass around your hat for
contributions. Let me suggest that you come to me first.”

The united offerings, though small individually, amounted to a dollar,
which Phil pocketed with much satisfaction. He did not remain after
recess, but resumed his wanderings, and about noon entered a grocery
store, where he made a hearty lunch. Thus far good fortune attended him,
but the time was coming, and that before long, when life would wear a
less sunny aspect.



CHAPTER XXV

PHIL FINDS A FRIEND

It was the evening before Christmas. Until to-day the winter had been an
open one, but about one o’clock in the afternoon the snow began to fall.
The flakes came thicker and faster, and it soon became evident that an
old-fashioned snowstorm had set in. By seven o’clock the snow lay a foot
deep on the level, but in some places considerably deeper, for a brisk
wind had piled it up in places.

In a handsome house, some rods back from the village street, lived Dr.
Drayton, a physician, whose skill was so well appreciated that he had
already, though still in the prime of life, accumulated a handsome
competence.

He sat this evening in his library, in dressing-gown and slippers, his
wife nearby engaged in some needlework.

“I hope you won’t be called out this evening, Joseph,” said Mrs.
Drayton, as a gust of wind tattled the window panes.

“I echo that wish, my dear,” said the doctor, looking up from the last
number of the Atlantic Monthly. “I find it much more comfortable here,
reading Dr. Holmes’ last article.”

“The snow must be quite deep.”

“It is. I found my ride from the north village this afternoon bleak
enough. You know how the wind sweeps across the road near the Pond
schoolhouse. I believe there is to be a Christmas-eve celebration in the
Town Hall this evening, is there not?”

“No; it has been postponed till to-morrow evening.”

“That will be better. The weather and walking will both be better. Shall
we go, Mary?”

“If you wish it,” she said, hesitatingly.

Her husband understood her hesitation. Christmas day was a sad
anniversary for them. Four years before, their only son, Walter, a boy
of eight, had died just as the Christmas church bells were ringing out a
summons to church. Since then the house had been a silent one, the quiet
unbroken by childish noise and merriment. Much as the doctor and his
wife were to each other, both felt the void which Walter’s death had
created, and especially as the anniversary came around which called to
mind their great loss.

“I think we had better go,” said the doctor; “though God has bereft us
of our own child, it will be pleasant for us to watch the happy faces of
others.”

“Perhaps you are right, Joseph.”

Half an hour passed. The doctor continued reading the Atlantic, while
his wife, occupied with thoughts which the conversation had called up,
kept on with her work.

Just then the bell was heard to ring.

“I hope it is not for you, Joseph,” said his wife, apprehensively.

“I am afraid it is,” said the doctor, with a look of resignation.

“I thought it would be too good luck for me to have the whole evening to
myself.”

“I wish you were not a doctor,” said Mrs. Drayton.

“It is rather too late to change my profession, my dear,” said her
husband, good-humoredly. “I shall be fifty next birthday. To be sure,
Ellen Jones tells me that in her class at the Normal School there is a
maiden lady of sixty-two, who has just begun to prepare herself for the
profession of a teacher. I am not quite so old as that.”

Here the servant opened the door, ushering in a farm laborer.

“Good-evening, Abner,” said the doctor, recognizing him, as, indeed, he
knew every face within half a dozen miles. “Anything amiss at home?”

“Mrs. Felton is took with spasms,” said Abner. “Can you come right
over?”

“What have you done for her?”

“Put her feet in warm water, and put her to bed. Can you come right
over?”

“Yes,” said the doctor, rising and exchanging his dressing-gown for
a coat, and drawing on his boots. “I will go as soon as my horse is
ready.”

Orders were sent out to put the horse to the sleigh. This was quickly
done, and the doctor, fully accoutered, walked to the door.

“I shall be back as soon as I can, Mary,” he said.

“That won’t be very soon. It is a good two-miles’ ride.”

“I shan’t loiter on the way, you may be sure of that. Abner, I am
ready.”

The snow was still falling, but not quite so fast as early in the
afternoon. The wind, however, blew quite as hard, and the doctor found
all his wrappings needful.

At intervals on the road he came to deep drifts of snow through which
the horse had some difficulty in drawing the sleigh, but at length he
arrived at the door of his patient. He found that the violence of her
attack was over, and, satisfied of this, left a few simple directions,
which he considered sufficient. Nature would do the rest.

“Now for home!” he said to himself. “I hope this will be my last
professional call this evening. Mary will be impatient for my return.”

He gave the reins to his horse, who appeared to feel that he was bound
homeward, and traveled with more alacrity than he had come.

He, too, no doubt shared the doctor’s hope that this was the last
service required of him before the morrow.

Doctor Drayton had completed rather more than half his journey, when,
looking to the right, his attention was drawn to a small, dark object,
nearly covered with snow.

Instinctively he reined up his horse.

“Good heavens!” he exclaimed, “it must be a boy. God grant he is not
frozen!”

He leaped from his sleigh, and lifted the insensible body.

“It is an Italian boy, and here is his violin. The poor child may be
dead,” he said to himself in a startled tone. “I must carry him home,
and see what I can do for him.”

So he took up tenderly our young hero--for our readers will have guessed
that it was Phil--and put both him and his violin into the sleigh. Then
he drove home with a speed which astonished even his horse, who, though
anxious to reach his comfortable stable, would not voluntarily have put
forth so great an exertion as was now required of him.

I must explain that Phil had for the last ten days been traveling about
the country, getting on comfortably while the ground was bare of snow.
To-day, however, had proved very uncomfortable. In the city the snow
would have been cleared off, and would not have interfered so much with
traveling.

He had bought some supper at a grocery store, and, after spending an
hour there, had set out again on his wanderings. He found the walking so
bad that he made up his mind to apply for a lodging at a house not
far back; but a fierce dog, by his barking, had deterred him from the
application. The road was lonely, and he had seen no other house since.
Finally, exhausted by the effort of dragging himself through the deep
snow, and, stiff with cold, he sank down by the side of the road, and
would doubtless have frozen had not the doctor made his appearance
opportunely.

Mrs. Drayton was alarmed when her husband entered the sitting-room,
bearing Phil’s insensible form.

She jumped to her feet in alarm.

“Who is it, Joseph?” she asked.
