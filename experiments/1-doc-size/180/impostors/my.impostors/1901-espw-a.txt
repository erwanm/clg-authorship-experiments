"Jean!" called Avery loudly; "Jean!"




PART II

At the claim of his voice she responded; smiling, she stirred.  He
could not help remembering how she had once said, "If I were dead, I
should answer you if you called me, Marshall."  And for the moment, she
had looked--but it was not death.

She opened her large eyes and regarded him--strangely, he thought, for
the instant; then with the lambent look which belonged to Jean, and
quite steadily.  He knelt by her, and drew the blanket up, and buttoned
the nightdress at her throat with clumsy fingers.

"I have come back to say"--he began.  But he could not say it.  "Have
you had an ill turn?" he temporized.

"I don't know," said Jean.

"How did you happen to be on the lounge?"

"I don't know," repeated Jean.

"Are you suffering, dear?"

"I fell asleep," said Jean, after some thought.

"Don't you remember when you got out of bed?"

"I have had a wonderful sleep," said Jean.  "I never had anything of
the kind before.  It was like heaven."

"Are you suffering now?"

"No--I think not--no.  I feel pretty weak.  But I am not suffering."

"Shall I call the doctor?"

"I sha'n't need the doctor.  I don't want ... I don't need anybody but
you."

She turned and put her hand to his cheek.  Her long hair fell away from
her face and revealed its expression; he turned his own away at sight
of it.

"How early you are dressed!" she said, in a different tone.

"I was going out," he stammered.  "I was--going away."

"Oh!  Going!  Where are you going?"

"I won't, if you don't want me to."

"You did n't say where you were going."

"Well, you see--Romer asked me to take a little trip with him.  He
thought I looked fagged out.  He starts in--Jove!  He starts in twenty
minutes."

"And you have n't had any breakfast!" said Jean; her divine
self-oblivion pushed to the front,--a trained soldier.  But her chin
trembled in a touching fashion that she had when she was too much
grieved to say so, or too weak to admit that she was grieved.

He had risen from his knees and stood beside her, looking down.  Her
weakness and her loveliness seemed to lift themselves towards him like
pleading things which he thrust off.  He felt uncomfortable and
irresolute.  He was conscious of trying not to look annoyed.

"You are going in a boat?" she asked, very faintly now.

"Well--yes--a sort of boat."  Avery fumbled fatuously.  "It's quite a
safe one," he added.  "And Romer says"--  He began to tell her what
Romer said.

"And guns?" she whispered.  "There will be guns?"

"Oh, I presume Tom has a gun," replied the husband, with what he felt
to be an ingenious veracity.  "You know I 'm no shot.  I don't like
guns much better than you do, dear....  I 'm getting late," he observed
abruptly.  "But I won't go, Jean, if you don't want me to.  I thought
it might set me up a little," he added, before she could reply.

In fact, she did not seem to incline to reply, or did not feel able to
do so; he could not tell which.  She lay looking up at him quite
steadily.  Molly had taken both the children into the nursery, and the
two were alone.  A clock ticked on the mantel in a loud, irritating
tone.  The white silk Spanish shawl which had fallen from the lounge
hung to his coat-sleeve; it was a delicate thing, and the fringe clung
like tendrils; he had to tear it off roughly.

He bethought him to wrap the shawl about her when he had done this, for
she seemed to be cold.  As he bent to perform for her this little
service--which was offered with an obtrusive tenderness--he stooped and
kissed her throat.  The soft, sweet flesh quivered at his touch.  Jean
raised her weak arms and clasped them about his neck.  But they fell
back instantly, as if the action had hurt her.

"Come, dear," he resumed hurriedly.  "Shall I go--or not?"

"I don't feel quite well," faltered Jean.  "I think--I slept too
long--that heavenly sleep ... last night"--

"I 'll go and tell Romer I can't go," said Avery shortly.  He started,
and went half across the room, then paused.  "Well, Jean?" he
suggested.  Jean did not reply.  She was lying just as he had left her,
with her arms fallen at her sides, her bright hair brushed back from
her face, which looked strangely prominent and large.  There was that
in her eyes which a man would not have refused in a dog.  The husband
returned impetuously to her side.

"Poor Jean!  I won't go.  Really I won't.  I 'll do just as you
say--truly I will.  Won't you say, Jean?  Won't you express a wish?"

But Jean shook her head.  The time had come when she had no wish to
express; and she seemed not to have the strength to express even the
fact that she had none.

"If you think it best ... for you" ...  The words were inarticulate.

"I really do," urged Avery uncomfortably.  "At least, I did--that is,
unless you are actually too ill to spare me....  How is a man to know?"
he muttered, not thinking she would hear.

"Good-by," breathed Jean.  She did not try to lift her arms this time.
He stooped and kissed her affectionately.  Her lips clung to his.  But
her eyes clung longer than her lips.  They clasped him until he felt
that if he did not throw them off, he could not get away.

Across the room he paused.  "I 'll send Thorne," he said.  "I 'll send
the doctor.  I can't go unless I feel quite safe about you.  And I 'll
call Molly as I go down."

He tried to add something about telegrams, and how short a trip it was,
and so on.  But Jean's eyes silenced him.  Solemn, mute, distant, they
looked upon him like the eyes of an alien being moving through the
experiences of an unknown world.  For a moment their expression
appalled him; it was not reproach; it was scarcely to be called
anguish; rather a fine and tragic astonishment, for which speech would
have been too coarse a medium.  But he shut the door, caught Pink, who
was crying for her breakfast, kissed the child, and went.

As he stepped out into the street, the morning air struck him a slap in
the face.  The wind was rising, and it hit him hard in the breast, as
if it had the mind to push him back.  He forced his way against it, and
reached the club out of breath and with suffused face, as if he were
blushing.  He flung an order at the desk:--

"Telephone for Dr. Thorne.  Tell him Mrs. Avery is n't feeling quite as
well as usual, and I am unfortunately called away.  He 'd better go
right over to the house."

He dashed into the dining-room, poured out a cup of coffee, and hurried
to the river-wall.  The Dream lay off in mid-stream--a white
seventy-footer schooner-rigged, with a new suit of sails that presented
an almost startling brightness in the early morning light.  The tender
was already manned, and rowed in impatiently at his signal.  He was
fifteen minutes late.  He said nothing to the crew, assuming the ready
lordliness of a poor man who had never owned and would never own a
yacht, but apologized rather unnecessarily to Romer when he got aboard,
explaining the circumstances with more minuteness than was necessary.

"Why, great Scott, man!" said Romer.  "I 'd have waited for you another
day--any number of them--if Mrs. Avery lifted an eyelash.  Put you
ashore now, if you say so."

But Avery shook his head magnanimously.  The yacht slipped her mooring
and swung slowly into the channel, careened under the strong westerly,
and slid away.  It was uncommon for pleasure boats of the Dream's class
to anchor in the river, but it had been Romer's whim; if he did not
value playing le bon prince at the club, he liked to do the uncommon
with his yacht; he amused himself and his guest with the laggard
process of getting out into the bay, pointing out the picturesqueness
gained at the expense of time and trouble, and making himself
entertaining--as Romer could--with the vivacity of a sportsman and the
ingenuity of an accomplished host.  Marshall Avery was not talkative,
