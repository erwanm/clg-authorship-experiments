an oval sign painted with the effigy of an eagle, a 
bundle of arrows, and certain thunderbolts, and 
bearing the legend, CONSULATE OF THE UNITED 
STATES, in neat characters. Don Ippolito gave a 
quick sigh, hesitated a moment, and then seized the 
bell-pull and jerked it so sharply that it seemed to 
thrust out, like a part of the mechanism, the head 
of an old serving-woman at the window above him. 

Who is there ? " demanded this head. 

" Friends," answered Don Ippolito in a rich, sad 
voice. 

" And what do you command ? " further asked 
the old woman. 

Don Ippolito paused, apparently searching for 
his voice, before he inquired, it here that the 
Consul of America lives ? " 

" Precisely." 

"Is he perhaps at home ? " 



 

" I don 't know. I will go ask him." 
" Do me that pleasure, dear," said Don Ippolito, 
and remained knotting his fingers before the closed 
door. Presently the old woman returned, and 
looking out long enough to say, "The consul is at 
home," drew some inner bolt by a wire running to 
the lock, that let the door start open ; then, waiting 
to hear Don Ippolito close it again, she called out 
from her height, " Favor me above." He climbed 
the dim stairway to the point where she stood, and 
followed her to a door, which she flung open into 
an apartment so brightly lit by a window looking 
on the sunny canal, that he blinked as he entered. 
" Signer Console," said the old woman, "behold 
the gentleman who desired to see you ; " and at the 
same time Don Ippolito, having removed his broad, 
stiff, three-cornered hat, came forward and made a 
beautiful bow. He had lost for the moment the 
trepidation which had marked his approach to the 
consulate, and bore himself with graceful dignity. 
It was in the first year of the war, and from a 
motive of patriotism common at that time, Mr. 
Ferris (one of my many predecessors in office at 
Venice) had just been crossing his two silken gon 
dola flags above the consular bookcase, where with 
their gilt lance-headed staves, and their vivid stars 
and stripes, they made a very pretty effect. He 
filliped a little dust from his coat, and begged Don 
Ippolito to be seated, with the air of putting even a 
Venetian priest on a footing of equality with other 
men under the folds of the national banner. Mr. 
Ferris had the prejudice of all Italian sympathizers 
against the priests ; but for this he could hardly 
have found anything in Don Ippolito to alarm dis 
like. His face was a little thin, and the chin was 
delicate ; the nose had a fine, Dantesque curve, but 
its final droop gave a melancholy cast to a counte 
nance expressive of a gentle and kindly spirit ; the 
eyes were large and dark and full of a dreamy 
warmth. Don Ippolito's prevailing tint was that 
transparent blueishness which comes from much 
shaving of a heavy black beard ; his forehead and 
temples were marble white ; he had a tonsure the 
size of a dollar. He sat silent for a little space, 
and softly questioned the consul's face with his 
dreamy eyes. Apparently lie could not gather 
courage to speak of his business at once, for he 
turned his gaze upon the window and said, " A 
beautiful position, Signor Console." 

" Yes, it's a pretty place," answered Mr. Ferris, 
warily. 

" So much pleasanter here on the Canalazzo than 
on the campos or the little canals." 

" Oh, without doubt." 

" Here there must be constant amusement in 
watching the boats : great stir, great variety, great 
life. And now the fine season commences, and the 
Signor Console's countrymen will be coming to 
Venice. Perhaps," added Don Ippolito with a 
polite dismay, and an air of sudden anxiety to 
escape from his own purpose, " I may be disturb 
ing or detaining the Signer Console ? " 

"No," said Mr. Ferris ; "I am quite at leisure 
for the present. In what can I have the honor of 
serving you ? " 

Don Ippolito heaved a long, ineffectual sigh, and 
taking his linen handkerchief from his pocket, 
wiped his forehead with it, and rolled it upon his 
knee. He looked at the door, and all round the 
room, and then rose and drew near the consul, who 
had officially seated himself at his desk. 

" I suppose that the Signor Console gives pass 
ports ? " he asked. 

" Sometimes," replied Mr. Ferris, with a cloud 
ing face. 

Don Ippolito seemed to note the gathering dis 
trust and to be helpless against it. He continued 
hastily : " Could the Signor Console give a pass 
port for America ... to me ? " 

" Are you an American citizen ? " demanded the 
consul in the voice of a man whose suspicions are 
fully roused. 

" American citizen ? " 

" Yes ; subject of the American republic." 

" No, surely ; I have not that happiness. I am 
an Austrian subject," returned Don Ippolito a little 
bitterly, as if the last words were an unpleasant 
morsel in the mouth. 

Then I can 't give you a passport," said Mr. 
Ferris, somewhat more gently. " You know," he 

explained, that no government can give passports 
to foreign subjects. That would be an unheard-of 
thing." 

" But I thought that to go to America an Amer 
ican passport would be needed." 

" In America," returned the consul, with proud 
compassion, " they don 't care a fig for passports. 
You go and you come, and nobody meddles. To be 
sure," he faltered, " just now, on account of the 
secessionists, they do require you to show a pass 
port at New York ; but," he continued more boldly, 
" American passports are usually for Europe ; and 
besides, all the American passports in the world 
wouldn 't get you over the frontier at Peschiera. 
You must have a passport from the Austrian Lieu 
tenancy of Venice," 

Don Ippolito nodded his head softly several times, 
and said, " Precisely," and then added with an in 
describable weariness, " Patience ! Signer Console, 
I ask your pardon for the trouble I have given," and 
he made the consul another low bow. 

Whether Mr. Ferris's curiosity was piqued, and 
feeling himself on the safe side of his visitor he 
meant to know why he had come on such an errand, 
or whether he had some kindlier motive, he could 
hardly have told himself, but he said, " I'm very 
sorry. Perhaps there is something else in which I 
could be of use to you." 

" Ah, I hardly know," cried Don Ippolito. " I 
really had a kind of hope in coming to your excel 
lency " 


" I am not an excellency," interrupted Mr. Ferris, 
conscientiously. 

" Many excuses ! But now it seems a mere besti 
ality. I was so ignorant about the other matter 
that doubtless I am also quite deluded in this." 

As to that, of course I can 't say," answered Mr.
