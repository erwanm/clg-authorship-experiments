' It is here on this side by advice of your council ? ' 

' Yes.' 

' Now, in God's name, can that wise council explain why 
it is better to have it here than it would be to have it in the 
bottom of the sea ? ' 

Dunois made some wandering attempts to explain the 
inexplicable and excuse the inexcusable, but Joan cut him 
short and said — 

' Answer me this, good sir — has the army any value on 
this side of the river ? ' 

The Bastard confessed that it hadn't — that is, in view of 
the plan of campaign which she had devised and decreed. 

' And yet, knowing this, you had the hardihood to dis- 
obey my orders. Since the army's place is on the other 
side, will you explain to me how it is to get there ? ' 

The whole size of the needless muddle was apparent. 
Evasions were of no use ; therefore Dunois admitted that 
there was no way to correct the blunder but to send the 
army all the way back to Blois, and let it begin over again 
and come up on the other side this time, according to Joan's 
original plan. 

Any other girl, after winning such a triumph as this over 
a veteran soldier of old renown, might have exulted a little 
and been excusable for it, but Joan showed no disposition 
of this sort. She dropped a word or two of grief over the 
precious time that must be lost, then began at once to issue 
commands for the march back. She sorrowed to see her 
army go ; for she said its heart was great and its enthusiasm 
hiofh, and that with it at her back she did not fear to face 
all the might of England.  

All arrangements having been completed for the return 
of the main body of the army, she took the Bastard and La 
Hire and a thousand men and went down to Orleans, where 
all the town was in a fever of impatience to have sight 
of her face. It was eight in the evening when she and the 
troops rode in at the Burgundy gate, with the Paladin pre- 
ceding her with her standard. She was riding a white horse 
and she carried in her hand the sacred sword of Fierbois. 
You should have seen Orleans then. What a picture it 

was ! Such black seas of people, such a starry firmament 
of torches, such roaring whirlwinds of welcome, such boom- 
ing of bells and thundering of cannon ! It was as if the 
world was come to an end. Everywhere in the glare of the 
torches one saw rank upon rank of upturned white faces, 
the mouths wide open, shouting, and the unchecked tears 
running down ; Joan forged her slow way through the solid 
masses, her mailed form projecting above the pavement of 
heads like a silver statue. The people about her struggled 
along, gazing up at her through their tears with the rapt 
look of men and women who believe they are seeing one 
who is divine ; and always her feet were being kissed by 
grateful folk, and such as failed of that privilege touched 
her horse and then kissed their fingers. 

Nothing that Joan did escaped notice ; everything she 
did was commented upon and applauded. You could hear 
the remarks going all the time. 

' There — she's smiling — see ! ' 

' Now she's taking her little plumed cap off to somebody 
— ah, it's fine and graceful ! ' 

' She's patting that woman on the head with her 
gauntlet.' 

' Qh, she was born on a horse — see her turn in her 
saddle, and kiss the hilt of her sword to the ladies in the 
window that threw the flowers down.' 

' Now there's a poor woman lifting up a child — she's 
kissed it — oh, she's divine ! ' 

' What a dainty little figure it is, and what a lovely face 
— and such colour and animation ! ' 

Joan's slender long banner streaming backward had an 
accident — the fringe caught fire from a torch. She leaned 
forward and crushed the flame in her hand. 

' She's not afraid of fire nor anything ! ' they shouted, 
and delivered a storm of admiring applause that made 
everything quake. 

She rode to the cathedral and gave thanks to God, and 
the people crammed the place and added their devotions to 

hers ; then she took up her march again and picked her 
slow way through the crowds and the wilderness of torches 
to the house of Jacques Boucher, treasurer of the Duke of 
Orleans, where she was to be the guest of his wife as long 
as she stayed in the city, and have his young daughter for 
comrade and room-mate. The delirium of the people went 
on the rest of the night, and with it the clamour of the joy- 
bells and the welcoming cannon. 

Joan of Arc had stepped upon her stage at last, and was 
ready to begin. 

CHAPTER XIV 

She was ready, but must sit down and wait until there was 
an army to work with. 

Next morning, Saturday, April 30, 1429, she set about 
inquiring after the messenger who carried her proclamation 
to the English from Blois — the one which she had dictated 
at Poitiers. Here is a copy of it. It is a remarkable docu- 
ment, for several reasons : for its matter-of-fact directness, 
for its high spirit and forcible diction, and for its naive con- 
fidence in her ability to achieve the prodigious task which 
she had laid upon herself, or which had been laid upon her 
— which you please. All through it you seem to see the 
pomps of war and hear the rumbling of the drums. In it 
Joan's warrior soul is revealed, and for the moment the soft 
little shepherdess has disappeared from your view. This 
untaught country damsel, unused to dictating anything at 
all to anybody, much less documents of state to kings and 
generals, poured out this procession of vigorous sentences 
as fluently as if this sort of work had been her trade from 
childhood : 

' JESUS MARIA 

' King of England, and you Duke of Bedford who call yourself Regent 
of France ; William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk ; and you Thomas Lord 
Scales, who style yourselves lieutenants of the said Bedford — do right to 
the King of Heaven. Render to the Maid who is sent by God the keys 

of all the good towns you have taken and violated in France. She is sent 
hither by God to restore the blood royal. She is very ready to make 
peace if you will do her right by giving up France and paying for what 
you have held. And you archers, companions of war, noble and other- 
wise, who are before the good city of Orleans, begone into your own 
land in God's name, or expect news fron the Maid who will shortly go to 
see you to your very great hurt. King of England, if you do not so, I am 
chief of war, and wherever I shall find your people in France I will drive 
them out, willing or not willing ; and if they do not obey I will slay them 
all, but if they obey, I will have them to mercy. I am come hither by God, 
the King of Heaven, body for body, to put you out of France, in spite of 
those who would work treason and mischief against the kingdom. Think 
not you shall ever hold the kingdom from the King of Heaven, the Son of 
the Blessed Mary ; King Charles shall hold it, for God wills it so, and has 
revealed it to him by the Maid. If you believe not the news sent by God 
through the Maid, wherever we shall meet you we will strike boldly and 
make such a noise as has not been in France these thousand years. Be 
sure that God can send more strength to the Maid than you can bring to 
any assault against her and her good men-at-arms ; and then we shall see 
who has the better right, the King of Heaven, or you. Duke of Bedford, 
the Maid prays you not to bring about your own destruction. If you do 
her right, you may yet go in her company where the French shall do the 
finest deed that has ever been done in Christendom, and if you do not, you 
shall be reminded shortly of your great wrongs. ' 

In that closing sentence she invites them to go on 
crusade with her to rescue the Holy Sepulchre. 

No answer had been returned to this proclamation, and 
the messenger himself had not come back. So now she 
sent her two heralds with a new letter warning the English 
to raise the siege and requiring them to restore that missing 
messenger. The heralds came back without him. All they 
brought was notice from the English to Joan that they 
would presently catch her and burn her if she did not clear 
out now while she had a chance, and ' go back to her 
proper trade of minding cows.' 

She held her peace, only saying it was a pity that the 
English would persist in inviting present disaster and
