with quiet deference, and passively assented, without imagin- 
ing regard as well as duty actuated him. It was not pos- 
sible, she thought, for him to do more than forgive her ; so, 
wrapping herself in the garment of humiliation, she took up 
her cross in silence, the pathetic wail of another burdened 
soul floating through hers with the pitiful cry, 

" O, do whate'er thou wilt ! I will be silent." 

Dr. Bertrand misunderstood her resignation, and felt a 
little disappointed. She, too, failed to read in his grave 
face the almost boundless kindness of his heart. So the 
interview was not as pleasant as the former one. But he 
was more than ever anxious to have her under Mrs. Wil- 
cox's care. 

The brief interval before her departure always seemed 
like a dream to Margaret. She scarcely crossed the thresh- 
old 'of the room where she had learned those strange, 
terrible lessons love, trust betrayed, hopes blighted and 
broken ; the solitary anguish of the soul that cries through 
black, bitter midnight, receiving no response ; the cruel, 
lingering death of the heart's first sweet bliss. For she felt 
love was indeed dead. Stranger hands would take him out 
to his burial when she left this room ; yet, until then, she 





could cast regretful glances in the narrow coffin. She 
neither longed for, nor expected, Robert's return. As she 
took down the pictures, she remembered the white, firm 
hands that had hung them, soft fingers that had threaded 
her hair, or held captive her little face until she kissed her 
way out to freedom. And here he had written in her books, 
" Margaret," " Maggie," " Madge." How beautifully clear 
and bold the letters were ! It was like looking over relics 
of the dead ; and when they were all packed, she experi- 
enced the desolate sensation of one after a funeral. 

Mrs. Davis was to accompany them to Orange. Much as 
Dr. Bertrand disliked it, he considered it a duty, and re- 
solved to perform his part pleasantly. But his brow con- 
tracted when she attired herself in a light gay-colored shawl, 
whose glaring flowers startled him. 

As if Margaret read the thought, she remarked, quietly, 

" I think I would wear the brown one, mother"; it is a 
chilly day, and that will not be warm enough." 

" La, child, how you do like that dull old thing ! This 
is a sight han'somer ; " but nevertheless she made the ex- 
change. 

Margaret was unexceptionable. Her paleness showed 
through her veil, and her voice sounded unnatural ; but her 
step did not waver. Mrs. Davis was chief conversationalist, 
and Richard felt thankful the journey was not long, and that 
he met no acquaintances. 

Mrs. Wilcox's flower-garden was still in bloom, but the 
path rustled with fallen leaves. Some tempting purple 
clusters remained on the grape-vine, and a hardy scarlet- 
runner clung to the porch in all its glory of bright berries. 
The mistress met them on the piazza, and was too well-bred 
to make any distinction in her greeting. She had Marga- 
ret's trunks sent immediately to her room, and ushering the 
others into the parlor, said, in a low tone, to her, " Would 
you like to take a glimpse of your new abode while you are 
laying off your bonnet and cloak ? " 





Margaret followed her guide. The room was large, with 
two windows fronting the street, and two overlooking the 
porch, and from thence the garden below. The walls were 
covered with tasteful paper, the snowy curtains drawn back 
by crimson cords : a pretty lounge in daniask, a low rocking 
chair, and the French bedstead, with its pure white belong- 
ings, first attracted her glance. The door of the little stove 
was partially open, and the ruddy glow of coals shone out 
warmly, giving a sense of home-like comfort. 

" Let me assist you," Mrs. Wilcox exclaimed, anxious for 
a nearer view of the face hidden behind the veil. " I hope 
you will like your new home. I shall do everything in my 
power to make it happy for you." 

" Thank you. You are very kind," Margaret managed 
to say, as she raised her pleading, timid eyes, swimming in 
tears, in spite of her efforts at self-control. 

" My poor child ! " Mrs. Wilcox's sympathy rushed out 
with the fond, motherly clasp, that pillowed Margaret's 
throbbing temples on her bosom. "You are tired and 
frightened. Presently we'll have a cup of tea, and a nice, 
cheerful talk. Then, if you like, I'll help you unpack. I 
want to be your friend as much for your own sake as for 
Dr. Bertrand's, though I have known him many a long 
year." 

Margaret pressed a yearning, convulsive kiss on the hands 
that enfolded her. Mrs. Wilcox substituted her warm face 
instead, and returned the caress fondly. 

" Now, I will show you about a little," she said, cheerily, 
as she remarked the almost hysteric sob that half strangled 
Margaret. "-Here is your wardrobe ; and here," opening 
the door to another closet, "you will find all washing con- 
veniences. I suppose we may as well leave everything until 
your friends are gone, however." 

Dr. Bertrand would have been surprised had he seen 
the effort .of Margaret's mental nature to rule the physical. 
A stratum of subtle strength ran through this fine soul, like 
 

flame coior in an opal, visible only in certain lights. It 
was susceptibility, and not weakness, that made her choose 
silence ; a knowledge that the external breakdown would be 
more painful to her tense nerves, than this inward anguish 
that was torturing her soul with inquisitorial pangs. Her 
deepest feelings shrank from witnesses. 

" Will you please send Mrs. Davis up," she asked, when 
she could steady her voice. " I think it would gratify her 
to see my room ; and they have only a few moments, as they 
wish to catch the return train." 

Mrs. Wilcox obeyed her behest immediately. 

" Well, I declare ! " and the voice sounded coarser than 
ever, amid these quiet surroundings, as Mrs. Davis took a 
survey ; " you've got everything nice and slick hain't you ? 
and your landlady seems a proper clever creetur. It's 
enough sight nicer than the shop ; that never did seem the 
place for you ! I hope you'll be contented. But, Marg'ret, 
if things don't go straight, or Dr. Bertrand gets offish, 
you can come back any time ; it's your home when you want 
it. I've tried to be a mother to you, but we wasn't made 
alike." 

" You have been very kind, I am sure." 

" If your father 'd lived, 'twould all 'a been different. I 
shouldn't worked so hard, and might 'a had time to smart 
up, and be a lady. But land ! it's all spilt milk. And here's 
suthin' for you the money Dr. Bertrand give me. You 
hold on to it, child ; it's two thousand dollars and over." 

Margaret drew back, and said, with loftiness, " Give it 
back to him,' 

" He hain't no business whatever with it. It's best to 
keep a close watch over your own. Nobody knows jest 
what's before 'em ; " and she crowded the money into Mar- 
garet's hand. 

" I s'pose it's about time for us to start. Now, keep chip- 
per, and don't get humsick ; and if you want anything o' me, 
jest write a line." 



 

" Thank you. And you must come to see me." 

" It's kinder hard for me to get away, you know; but I'll 
come in a minute if you send for me." 

They went down stairs together. Richard looked quite 
cheerful. Mrs. Wilcox's account had been better than he 
hoped for, and very satisfactory. The farewells were neces- 
sarily brief.
