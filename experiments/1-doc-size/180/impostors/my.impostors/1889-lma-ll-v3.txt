often say, ’Have faith and hold up thy hands; God will fill them.’"

Then Trudel went away to her work, with a stout heart under her little
blue bodice; and all that summer day she trudged to and fro along the
webs of linen spread in the green meadow, watering them as fast as they
dried, knitting busily under a tree during the intervals.

Old Gretti was glad to have her, and at noon called her in to share the
milk-soup, with cherries and herrings in it, and a pot of coffee,--as
well as Dutch cheese, and bread full of coriander-seed. Though this was
a feast to Trudel, one bowl of soup and a bit of bread was all she ate;
then, with a face that was not half as "bold" as she tried to make it,
she asked if she might run home and take the coffee to grandmother, who
longed for and needed it so much.

"Yes, indeed; there, let me fill that pewter jug with a good hot mess
for the old lady, and take this also.  I have little to give, but I
remember how good she was to me in the winter, when my poor legs were so
bad, and no one else thought of me," said grateful Gretti, mixing more
coffee, and tucking a bit of fresh butter into half a loaf of bread with
a crusty end to cover the hole.

Away ran Trudel; and when grandmother saw the "blessed coffee," as she
called it, she could only sip and sigh for comfort and content, so glad
was the poor old soul to taste her favorite drink again.  The mother
smelled it, and came down to take her share, while Trudel skipped away
to go on watering the linen till sunset with a happy heart, saying to
herself while she trotted and splashed,--

"This day is well over, and I have kept my word.  Now what can I do
to-morrow?  Gretti does n’t want me; there is no market; I must not beg
yet, and I cannot finish the hose so soon.

"I know!  I ’ll get water-cresses, and sell them from door to door.
They are fresh now, and people like them.  Ah, thou dear duck, thank
thee for reminding me of them," she cried, as she watched a mother-duck
lead her brood along the brook’s edge, picking and dabbling among the
weeds to show them where to feed.

Early next morning Trudel took her basket and went away to the meadows
that lay just out of the town, where the rich folk had their summer
houses, and fish-ponds, and gardens.  These gardens were gay now with
tulips, the delight of Dutch people; for they know best how to cultivate
them, and often make fortunes out of the splendid and costly flowers.

When Trudel had looked long and carefully for cresses, and found very
few, she sat down to rest, weary and disappointed, on a green bank from
which she could overlook a fine garden all ablaze with tulips.  She
admired them heartily, longed to have a bed of them her own, and feasted
her childish eyes on the brilliant colors till they were dazzled, for
the long beds of purple and yellow, red and white blossoms were splendid
to see, and in the midst of all a mound of dragon-tulips rose like a
queen’s throne, scarlet, green, and gold all mingled on the ruffled
leaves that waved in the wind.

Suddenly it seemed as if one of the great flowers had blown over the
wall and was hopping along the path in a very curious way!  In a minute,
however, she saw that it was a gay parrot that had escaped, and would
have flown away if its clipped wings and a broken chain on one leg had
not kept it down.

Trudel laughed to see the bird scuttle along, jabbering to itself, and
looking very mischievous and naughty as it ran away.  She was just
thinking she ought to stop it, when the garden-gate opened, and a pretty
little boy came out, calling anxiously,--

"Prince!  Prince!  Come back, you bad bird! I never will let you off
your perch again, sly rascal!"

"I will get him;" and Trudel ran down the bank after the runaway, for
the lad was small and leaned upon a little crutch.

"Be careful!  He will bite!" called the boy.

"I ’m not afraid," answered Trudel; and she stepped on the chain, which
brought the "Prince of Orange" to a very undignified and sudden halt.
But when she tried to catch him up by his legs, the sharp black beak
gave a nip and held tightly to her arm.  It hurt her much, but she did
not let go, and carried her captive back to its master, who thanked her,
and begged her to come in and chain up the bad bird, for he was
evidently rather afraid of it.

Glad to see more of the splendid garden, Trudel did what he asked, and
with a good deal of fluttering, scolding, and pecking, the Prince was
again settled on his perch.

"Your arm is bleeding!  Let me tie it up for you; and here is my cake to
pay you for helping me.  Mamma would have been very angry if Prince had
been lost," said the boy, as he wet his little handkerchief in a tank of
water near by, and tied up Trudel’s arm.

The tank was surrounded by pots of tulips; and on a rustic seat lay the
lad’s hat and a delicious large kuchen, covered with comfits and sugar.
The hungry girl accepted it gladly, but only nibbled at it, remembering
those at home. The boy thought she did not like it, and being a generous
little fellow and very grateful for her help, he looked about for
something else to give her.  Seeing her eyes fixed admiringly on a
pretty red jar that held a dragon-tulip just ready to bloom, he said
pleasantly,--

"Would you like this also?  All these are mine, and I can do as I like
with them.  Will you have it?"

"Oh, yes, with thanks!  It is so beautiful! I longed for one, but
never thought to get it," cried Trudel, receiving the pot with delight.

Then she hastened toward home to show her prize, only stopping to sell
her little bunches of cresses for a few groschen, with which she bought
a loaf and three herrings to eat with it.  The cake and the flower gave
quite the air of a feast to the poor meal, but Trudel and the two women
enjoyed it all, for the doctor said that the father was better, and now
needed only good meat and wine to grow strong and well again.

How to get these costly things no one knew, but trusted they would come,
and all fell to work with lighter hearts.  The mother sat again at her
lace-work, for now a ray of light could be allowed to fall on her pillow
and bobbins by the window of the sick-room.  The old woman’s fingers
flew as she knit at one long blue stocking; and Trudel’s little hands
tugged away at the other, while she cheered her dull task by looking
fondly at her dear tulip unfolding in the sun.

She began to knit next day as soon as the breakfast of dry bread and
water was done; but she took her work to the doorstep and thought busily
as the needles clicked, for where could she get money enough for meat
and wine?  The pretty pot stood beside her, and the tulip showed its gay
leaves now, just ready to bloom.  She was very proud of it, and smiled
and nodded gayly when a neighbor said in passing, "A fine flower you
have there."

Soon she forgot it, however, so hard was her little brain at work, and
for a long time she sat with her eyes fixed on her busy hands so
intently that she neither heard steps approaching, nor saw a maid and a
little girl looking over the low fence at her.  Suddenly some words in a
strange language made her look up.  The child was pointing at the tulip
and talking fast in English to the maid, who shook her head and tried to
lead her on.

She was a pretty little creature, all in white with a gay hat, curly
locks, and a great doll in one arm, while the other held a box of
bonbons. Trudel smiled when she saw the doll; and as if the friendly
look decided her, the little girl ran up to the door, pointed to the
flower, and asked a question in the queer tongue which Trudel could not
understand.  The maid followed, and said in Dutch, "Fräulein Maud wishes
the flower.  Will you give it to her, child?"

"Oh, no, no!  I love it.  I will keep it, for now Jan is gone, it is all
I have!" answered Trudel, taking the pot in her lap to guard her one
treasure.

The child frowned, chattered eagerly, and offered the box of sweets, as
if used to having her wishes gratified at once.  But Trudel shook her
head, for much as she loved "sugar-drops," she loved the splendid flower
better, like a true little Dutchwoman.

Then Miss Maud offered the doll, bent on having her own way.  Trudel
hesitated a moment, for the fine lady doll in pink silk, with a feather
in her hat, and tiny shoes on her feet, was very tempting to her
childish soul.  But she felt that so dainty a thing was not for her, and
her old wooden darling, with the staring eyes and broken nose, was
dearer to her than the delicate stranger could ever be.  So she smiled
to soothe the disappointed child, but shook her head again.

At that, the English lassie lost her temper, stamped her foot, scolded,
and began to cry, ordering the maid to take the flower and come away at
once.

"She will have it; and she must not cry. Here, child, will you sell it
for this?" said the maid, pulling a handful of groschen out of her deep
pocket, sure that Trudel would yield now.

But the little house-mother’s quick eye saw that the whole handful would
not buy the meat and wine, much as it looked, and for the third time she
shook her yellow head.  There was a longing look in her face, however;
and the shrewd maid saw it, guessed that money would win the day, and
diving again into her apron-pocket, brought out a silver gulden and held
it up.

"For this, then, little miser?  It is more than the silly flower is
worth; but the young fräulein must have all she wants, so take it and
let us be done with the crying."
