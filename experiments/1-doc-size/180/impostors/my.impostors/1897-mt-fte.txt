A SWELTERING DAY IN AUSTRALIA. 

{To be read soft and low, with Vie lights turned down.) 

The Bombola faints in the hot Bowral tree, 
"Where fierce MuUengudgery's smothering fires 

Far from the breezes of Coolgardie 
Burn ghastly and blue as the day expires ; 

And Murriwillumba complaineth in song 
For the garlanded bowers of Woolloomooloo, 

And the Ballarat Fly and the lone WoUongong 
They dream of the gardens of Jamberoo ; 



TOWN POETRY. 

The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgr, 

For the velvety sod of the Munno Para, 
Where the waters of healing from Muloowurii'e 

Flow dim in the gloaming by YaranyacMA ; 

The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway, 

And sigheth in secret for Murrurundi, 
The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day 

That made him an exile from Jerrilde?ne ; 

The Teawaraute Tumut from Wirrega's glade, 

The Nangkita swallow, the Wallaroo swan, 
They long for the peace of the imarishade 

And thy balmy soft airs, O sweet Mittagong I 

The Kooringa buffalo pants in the sun, 

The Kondoparinga lies gaping for breath. 
The Kongorong Camaum to the shadow has won. 

But the Goomeroo sinks in the slumber of death ; 

In the weltering hell of the Moorooroo plain 

The Yatala Wangary withers and dies. 
And the Worrow Wanilla, demented with pain, 

To the Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies ; 

Sweet Nangwarry's desolate, Coonamble wails, 

And Tungkillo Kuito in sables is drest, 
For the Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails 

And the Booleroo life- breeze is dead in the west. 

Mypongo, Kapunda, O slumber no more ! 

Yankalilla, Parawirra, be warned ! 
There's death in the air ! Killanoola, wherefore 

Shall the prayer of Penola be scorned ? 

Cootaniundra, and Takee, and Wakatipu, 

Toowoomba, Kaikoura are lost ! > 
From Onkaparinga to fa Damax irr 

All burn in this hell's holocaust ! 

Paramatta and Bijuuji re gone to their rest 

In the vale ofa pagg l Taroom, 
Kawakawa, Deniliquin — all that was best 

In thie earth are but graves and a tomb ! 

Narrandera mourns,lmerQ9 answers not 
ael>sthe roll of the scathless we cry : 

Goondiwindi, Woolundunga, the spot 
Islnute and forlorn where ye lie.  

Those are good words for poetry. Among the best I have 
ever seen. There are 81 in the list. I did not need them all, 
but I have knocked down 66 of them ; which is a good bag, it 
seems to me, for a person not in the business. Perhaps a poet 
laureate could do better, but a poet laureate gets wages, and 
that is different. When I write poetry I do not get any wages ; 
often I lose money by it. The best word in that list, and the 
most musical and gurgly, is Woolloomoolloo. It is a place 
near Sydney, and is a favorite pleasure-resort. It has eight 
O's in it. 




CHAPTER XXXVII. 

To succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown ; in the law, conceal- 
ment of it will do.— PudcCnhead Wilson''s New Calendar. 

KA ONDAY, December 23, 1895. Sailed from Sydney for 
Ceylon in the P. & O. steamer Oceana. A Lascar 
" crew mans this ship — the first I have seen. White 

cotton petticoat and pants ; barefoot ; red shawl for belt ; 
straw cap, brimless, on head, with red scarf wound around it ; 
complexion a rich dark brown ; short straight black hair ; 
whiskers fine and silky ; lustrous and intensely black. Mild, 
good faces ; willing and obedient people ; capable, too ; but 
are said to go into hopeless panics when there is danger. They 
are from Bomba}'' and the coast thereabouts. . . . Left 
some of the trunks in Sydney, to be shipped to South Africa
