" Thank you ! "' growled the host. " I suppose you 
have no objection to my informing the Confederate- 
States military officers in the city of your presence 
here?" 

" Not the slightest," answered De Banyan promptly. 
" I propose to inform them myself in due time." 

" What did you say your name was?' 

" Captain Sheffield." 

"Of Petersburg?" 

" No, sir." 

"Not of Petersburg?" 

"No, sir: of Nashville, Tennessee, which I can 
further inform you is the capital of the State. I have 
the honor to be a captain in the Third Tennessee. I 
served in Mexico, in the Crimea, and in Italy. I was 
present at four battles in the Crimea, seven in Italy, five 
in Mexico : I have been engaged in nine battles of the 
present war, and have been wounded six times." 

" Were you ever killed?" 

" Never was so unfortunate. Can I furnish you with 
any further information ? " 

" No more at present," replied the doctor, compressing 
his lips, apparently to keep from laughing, but really 
because he could not think of any thing sharp enough to 
dash so ready a talker. " If you do me the honor to 



 

remain here a week, I shall have better opportunities of 
hearing your marvellous experience, Captain Sheffield. 
Ah, what have we here?" continued he as three horse- 
men galloped up the roadway. 

A violent knocking was presently heard at the side 
door of the house, and Dr. Scoville hastened to learn the 
errand of the excited visitors. 



 




CHAPTER XXIX. 

DE BANYAN AT WORK. 

HOW do you feel, my dear boy?" asked Captain 
de Banyan as soon as the doctor had left the 
room. 

Somers, by the skilful applications of the 
physician, had been restored to consciousness, and had 
listened with astonishment, not unmingled with alarm, 
to the last part of the conversation between his friend 
and their host. 

" I feel a little better, captain : at any rate, I am more 
comfortable," replied Somers. 

" I am glad to hear it. I have been terribly worried 
about you.' 

" I think I shall do well enough. But what shall I 
say for myself? " 

" Say nothing, Somers, not a word. Don't commit 
yourself to any thing." 

" What have you told him?" 

"Nothing; and I don't intend to tell him anything. 



He is a jolly old fellow, who thinks he is very eccentric, 
and takes pride in being considered so. When I was 
in the Crimea " 

" Never mind the Crimea now," interrupted Somers 
with a languid smile. 

" I was only going to say that I understand the old 
doctor first-rate, and can manage him as easily as I 
could an old plough-horse. Keep still, Somers : don't 
let on, under any circumstances. Leave me to do all the 
talking." 

" But the cavalry are after us now." 

" Never mind : the doctor will take care of them." 

" They will recognize our horses, if they don't know 
us." 




No matter if they do." 

Somers thought it was matter ; and he could not see 
for the life of him how De Banyan was to get out of 
such a scrape as this ; for it was an infinitely worse one 
than his own experience on the Williamsburg Road. He 
could only hope for the best, expecting nothing but 
disaster. 

" Good ! Bully for the doctor ! " exclaimed De Ban 
yan as the sounds of an excited controversy at the side 
door reached the ears of the patient and his friend. 
" He is doing just what I expected him to do." 

"Pray, what did you expect him to do?" asked 
Somers , who could not see what a rebel surgeon 



 

could be expected to do under the circumstances, be- 
sides delivering them up to the military authorities. 

" I expect him to protect us to the utmost of his abil- 
ity ; and, in my opinion, he has quite as much influence as 
any other man in Petersburg. When you see a man like 
Dr. Scoville, you may depend upon it he is a power in 
the community where he lives. He knows it as well as 
any other person. Let the doctor alone, and he will 
manage the matter as skilfully as he dressed your 
wounded arm." 

Whatever confidence Captain de Banyan had in the will 
and the ability of Dr. Stoville to protect them, he was 
curious to hear what the soldiers and what the doctor 
had to say. He was not quite willing to be seen by the 
rebel soldiers : so he passed quickly into the entry, and 
took a position where he could hear without being 
observed. 

" Do you know who I am? you villain ! " demanded 
the doctor, in tones so full of rage, that the troopers 
ought to have been annihilated, though it appears that 
they were not. 

" I don't care who you are : I want the men that came 
here an hour ago," replied one of the troopersr 

" If Jeff. Davis' himself came for them, he couldn't 
have them ! " roared Dr. Scoville. 

" I tell you, sir, one of them is a deserter, and the 
other is a Yankee." 



" I don't care what they are. Report rny answer to 
the provost-marshal : tell him Dr. Scoville will b& 
responsible for the safety of the men." 
I won't report any such answer to him." 
If a man of you attempts to enter my house, I'll 
shoot him ! " replied the doctor, taking a rifle from a nail 
in the entry. 

" Very well, sir : if you can shoot any better than we 
can, you may begin," said the soldier. " But, as sure as 
you fire, you are a dead man."
