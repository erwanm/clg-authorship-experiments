CHAPTER XXIX.

AUNT MARIA FREES HER MIND.


The door opened, to let out the two gentlemen, just as Mrs. Wouvermans
was coming up the steps, fresh and crisp as one out betimes on the
labors of a good conscience.

The dear woman had visited the Willises, at the remote end of the
city, had had diplomatic conversations with both mistress and maid in
that establishment, and had now arrived as minister plenipotentiary
to set all matters right in Eva's establishment. She had looked
all through the subject, made up her mind precisely what Eva ought
to do, revolved it in her own mind as she sat apparently attending
to a rather drowsy sermon at her church, and was now come, as full
of sparkling vigor and brisk purposes as a well-corked bottle of
champagne.

Eva met her at the door with the dutiful affection which she had
schooled herself to feel towards one whose intentions were always so
good, but with a secret reserve of firm resistance as to the lines of
her own proper personality.

"I have a great deal to do, to-day," said the lady, "and so I came out
early to see you before you should be gone out or anything, because I
had something very particular I wanted to say to you."

Eva took her aunt's things and committed them to the care of Maggie,
who opened the parlor-door at this moment.

Aunt Maria turned towards the girl in a grand superior way and fixed a
searching glance on her.

"Maggie," she said, "is this you? I'm astonished to see you here."

The words were not much, but the intonation and manner were meant
to have all the effect of an awful and severe act of judgment on a
detected culprit--to express Mrs. Wouvermans' opinion that Maggie's
presence in any decent house was an impertinence and a disgrace.

Maggie's pale face turned a shade paler, and her black eyes flashed
fire, but she said nothing; she went out and closed the door with
violence.

"Did you see that?" said Aunt Maria, turning to Eva.

"I saw it, Aunty, and I must say I think it was more your fault than
Maggie's. People in our position ought not to provoke girls, if we do
not want to excite temper and have rudeness."

"Well, Eva, I've come up here to have a plain talk with you about
this girl, for I think you don't know what you're doing in taking her
into your house. I've talked with Mrs. Willis, and with your Aunt
Atkins, and with dear Mrs. Elmore about it, and there is but just one
opinion--they are all united in the idea that you ought not to take
such a girl into your family. You never can do anything with them;
they are utterly good for nothing, and they make no end of trouble.
I went and talked to your mother, but she is just like a bit of tow
string, you can't trust her any way, and she is afraid to come and
tell you what she really thinks, but in her heart she feels just as
the rest of us do."

"Well, now, upon my word, Aunt Maria, I can't see what right you and
Mrs. Willis and Aunt Atkins and Mrs. Elmore have to sit as a jury on
my family affairs and send me advice as to my arrangements, and I'm
not in the least obliged to you for talking about my affairs to them.
I think I told you, some time ago, that Harry and I intend to manage
our family according to our own judgment; and, while we respect you,
and are desirous of showing that respect in every proper way, we
cannot allow you any right to intermeddle in our family matters. I am
guided by my husband's judgment (and you yourself admit that, for a
wife, there is no other proper appeal) and Harry and I act as one. We
are entirely united in all our family plans."

"Oh, well, I suppose there is no harm in my taking an interest in your
family matters, since you are my god-child, and I brought you up, and
have always cared as much about you as any mother could do--in fact, I
think I have felt more like a mother to you than Nellie has."

"Well, Aunty," said Eva, "of course, I feel how kind and good you
have always been, and I'm sure I thank you with all my heart; but
still, after all, we must be firm in saying that you cannot govern our
family."

"Who is wanting to govern your family?--what ridiculous talk that
is! Just as if I had ever tried; but you may, of course, allow your
old aunt, that has had experience that you haven't had, to propose
arrangements and tell you of things to your advantage, can't you?"

"Oh, of course, Aunty."

"Well, I went up to the Willises, because they are going to Europe, to
be gone for three years, and I thought I could secure their Ann for
you. Ann is a treasure. She has been ten years with the Willises, and
Mrs. Willis says she don't know of a fault that she has."

"Very well, but, Aunty, I don't want Ann, if she were an angel; I have
my Mary, and I prefer her to anybody that could be named."

"But, Eva, Mary is getting old, and she is encumbered with this witch
of a daughter, whom she is putting upon your shoulders and making you
carry; and I perceive that you'll be ridden to death--it's a perfect
Old Man of the Sea on your backs. Now, get rid of Mary, and you'll get
rid of the whole trouble. It isn't worth while, just because you've
got attached to Mary, to sacrifice your interests for her sake. Just
let her go."

"Well, now, Aunty, the short of the matter is, that I will do
nothing of the kind. I won't let Mary go, and I don't want any other
arrangement than just what I have. I am perfectly satisfied."

"Well, you'll see that your keeping that girl in your house will
bring you all into disgrace yet," said Aunt Maria, rising hastily.
"But it's no use talking. I spent a good half-day attending to this
matter, and making arrangements that would have given you the very
best of servants; but if you choose to take in tramps, you must take
the consequences. I can't help it;" and Aunt Maria rose vengefully and
felt for her bonnet.

Eva opened the door of the little sewing-room, where Maggie had laid
it, and saw her vanishing out of the opposite door.

"I hope she did not hear you, Aunty," she said, involuntarily.

"I don't care if she did," was the reply, as the injured lady resumed
her bonnet and departed from the house, figuratively shaking the dust
from her feet.

Eva went out also to attend to some of her morning business, and, on
her return, was met by Mary with an anxious face. Maggie had gone
out and taken all her things with her, and was nowhere to be found.
After some search, Eva found a paper pinned to the cushion of her
toilet-table, on which was written:

     "Dear Mrs. Henderson: You have tried hard to save me; but
     it's no use. I am only a trouble to mother, and I disgrace
     you. So I am going, and don't try to find me. May God bless
     you and mother.

          MAGGIE."




CHAPTER XXX.

A DINNER ON WASHING DAY.


The world cannot wait for anybody. No matter whose heart breaks or
whose limbs ache, the world must move on. Life always has its next
thing to be done, which comes up imperatively, no matter what happens
to you or me.

So when it appeared that Maggie was absolutely gone--gone without
leaving trace or clue where to look for her, Mary, though distressed
and broken-hearted, had small time for lamentations.

For just as Maggie's note had been found, read, and explained to Mary,
and in the midst of grief and wonderment, a note was handed in to Eva
by an office-boy, running thus:

     "Dear Little Wifie: I have caught Selby, and we can have
     him at dinner to-night; and as I know there's nothing like
     you for emergencies, I secured him, and took the liberty of
     calling in on Alice and Angie, and telling them to come. I
     shall ask St. John, and Jim, and Bolton, and Campbell--you
     know, the more the merrier, and, when you are about it,
     it's no more trouble to have six or seven than one; and now
     you have Maggie, one may as well spread a little.

          Your own

               HARRY."

"Was ever such a man!" said Eva; "poor Mary! I'm sorry all this is
to come upon you just as you have so much trouble, but just hear
