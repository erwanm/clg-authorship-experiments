" My dear boy, they haven't got the genius of 
organisation. It takes a very masculine man for 
that — a man who combines the most subtle and 
refined sympathies with the most forceful purposes 
and the most ferruginous will power. Which his 
name is Angus Beaton, and here he sets ! " 

The others laughed with Fulkerson at his gross 
burlesque of flattery, and Beaton frowned sheepishly. 
" I suppose you understand this man's style," he 
growled toward March. 

' ' They do, my son," said Fulkerson. " They 
know that I cannot tell a lie." He pulled out his 
watch, and then got suddenly upon his feet. 

" It 's quarter of twelve, and I 've got an appoint- 



 

mcnt. Beaton rose too, and Fulkerson put the 
two books in his lax hands. " Take these along, 
Michelangelo Da Vinci, my friend, and put your 
multitudinous mind on them for about an hour, 
and let us hear from you to-morrow. We hang 
upon your decision." 

" There 's no deciding to be done," said Beaton. 
" You can't combine the two styles. They 'd kill 
each other." 

" A Dan'el, a Dan'el come to judgment ! I knew 
you could help us out ! Take 'em along, and tell us 
which will go the furthest "with the ewij JFeihliche. 
Dryfoos, I want a word with you." Ho led the way 
into the front room, flirting an airy farewell to 
Beaton with his hand as he went. 



VII. 

March and Beaton remained alone together for a 
moment, and March said : " I hope you v:iU think 
it worth while to take hold with us, Mr. Beaton. 
Mr. Fulkerson puts it in his own way, of course ; 
but we really want to make a nice thing of the 
magazine." He had that timidity of the elder in 
the presence of the younger man which the younger, 
preoccupied with his own timidity in the presence of 
the elder, cannot imagine. Besides, March was aware 
of the gulf that divided him as a literary man from 
Beaton as an artist, and he only ventured to feel his 
way towai'd sympathy with hinu " AYe want to 
make it good ; we want to make it high. Fulker- 
son is right about aiming to please the women, but 
of course he caricatures the way of going about it." 

For answer, Beaton flung out, " I can't go in for 
a thing I don't understand the plan of." 

March took it for granted that he had wounded 
some exposed sensibility of Beaton's. He continued 
still more deferentially : " Mr. Fulkerson's notion — 
I must say the notion is his, evolved from his syndi- 
cate experience — is that we shall do best in fiction 
to confine ourselves to short stories, and make each 




number complete in itself. lie found that the nio.st 
successful things he could furnish his newspajjcns 
were short stories ; "we Americans are supposed to 
excel in writing them ; and most people begin with 
them in fiction ; and it 's Mr. Fulkcrson's idea to 
work unknown talent, as he says, and so he thinks 
he can not only get them easily, but can gradually 
form a school of short-story writers. I can't say I 
follow him altogether, but I respect his experience. 
We shall not despise translations of short stories, 
but otherwise the matter will all be original, and of 
course it won't all be short stories. "We shall use 
sketches of travel, and essays, and little dramatic 
studies, and bits of biography and history ; but all 
very light, and always short enough to be completed 
in a single number. Mr. Fulkcrson believes in pic- 
tures, and most of the things would be capable of 
illustration." 

" I see," said Beaton. 

" I don't know but this is the whole afTair," said 
March, beginning to stiffen a little at the young 
man's reticence. 

" I understand. Thank you for taking the trouble 
to explain. Good morning." Beaton bowed him- 
self off, without offering to shake hands. 

Fulkerson came in after a  while from the outer 
office, and Mr. Dryfoos followed him. " "Well, what 
do you think of our art editor ? " 

" Is he our art editor ? " asked March. '  I wasn't 
quite certain when he left." 

" Did he take the books ? " 



 

" Yes, he took tlic books." 

" I guess he 's all right, then." Fulkerson added, 
in concession to the umbrage he detected in March, 
" Beaton has his times of being the greatest ass in 
the solar system, but he usually takes it out in per- 
sonal conduct. When it comes to work, he 's a 
regular horse." 

" He appears to have compromised for the present 
by being a perfect mule," said March. 

" Well, he 's in a transition state," Fulkerson 
allowed. " He 's the man for us. He really under- 
stands what we want. You 'll see ; he 'll catch on. 
That lurid glare of his will wear off in the course of 
time. He 's really a good fellow when you take him 
off his guard ; and he 's full of ideas. He 's spread 
out over a good deal of ground at present, and so he 's 
pretty thin ; but come to gather him up into a lump, 
there 's a good deal of substance to him. Yes, there 
is. He 's a first-rate critic, and he 's a nice fellow 
with the other artists. They laugh at his univer- 
sality, but they all like him. He 's the best kind of 
a teacher when he condescends to it ; and he 's just 
the man to deal with our volunteer work. Yes, sir, 
he's a prize. Well, I must go now." 

Fulkerson went out of the street door and then 
came quickly back. "By-the-by, March, I saw that 
old dynamiter of yours round at Beaton's room 
yesterday." 

" What old dynamiter of mine ? " 

" That old one-handed Dutchman — friend of your 
youth — the one we saw at Maroni's " 



 

" Oh — Lindau ! " said March, with a vague pang 
of self-reproach for having thought of Lindau so 
Httlc after the first flood of his tender feeling toward 
him was past 

" Yes, our versatile friend was modelling him as 
Judas Iscariot. Lindau makes a first-rate Judas, 
and Beaton has got a big thing in that head if he 
works the religious people right. But what I was 
thinking of was this — it struck me just as I was 
going out of the door : Didn't you tell me Lindau 
knew forty or fifty different languages ? " 

" Four or five, yes." 

" Well, we won't quarrel about the uundjcr. The 
question is, why not work him in the field of foreign 
literature ? You can't go over all their reviews and 
magazines, and he could do the smelling for you, if 
you could trust his nose. Would he Icnow a good 
thing ? " 

" I think he would," said March, on whom the
