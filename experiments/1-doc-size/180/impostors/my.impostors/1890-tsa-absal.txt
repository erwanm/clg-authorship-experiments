feathers, handed over to my old master, who seemed well 
pleased with his bargain. The same day Horace came 
with his master to our tent to bring something. I hastened 
towards him, embraced him with tears, and shared with 
him gome snails which I had found in the morning, and 
which were almost our only nourishment.. Sidi Hamet, 
who was present, doubted no longer that I was really 
Horace's father, and told me that in two days he should 
start for Mogadore, but that he had endeavored to buy my 
son in vain, for his master would sell him at no price. 

" If that is the case," said I, " leave me here, and take 
my son to Mogadore; I will be a faithful slave to his 
master as long as I live. You will receive the same sum 
for him that you would for me, and will then send him to 
his mother, whom I cannot see again without him." 

" By Allah" cried Sidi Hamet, " you shall have your 
son."

To effect this purchase the whole horde was collected 
together ; the transaction lasted the whole afternoon, and 
was several times so warm that blows and even sabre-cuts 
were interchanged. In the evening I learnt that Horace 
had been purchased at a high price, and his master had 
been forced by his friends to give him up to Sidi Hamet. 
I now redoubled my exertions to induce him to buy my 
other companions, and promised him a large ransom for 
them ; but he always refused, saying that our road lay 
through a most unsafe part of the country, where, if he 
had any quantity of slaves with him, he should be mur- 
dered for them by the wild robber Arabs. Nevertheless T 
succeeded at last in persuading him to buy three more of 
my companions. All further entreaties were in vain, for 
Sidi Hamet declared that he had now invested his whole 
property in us, and that if I had deceived him he was a 
ruined man. I was therefore obliged, in the presence of 
his brother, a siirly, disagreeable man, whom Sidi himself 
called a bad fellow, but who had assisted in purchasing us, 
to repeat solemnly my promise, and the exact amount of 
our ransom, adding that I would willingly give myself up 
to death, if I should be found to have practised a fraud. 

Kefreshed and strengthened by the milk that Sidi 
Hamet begged for me from my old master, and yet more 
by the hope of a speedy deliverance, I felt like quite 
another man, although we had very little food, and could 
sometimes find nothing but snails with which to appease 
our hunger. We were, therefore, not a little rejoiced wheÂ»j 




Sidi Hamet determined to slaughter a camel for provision 
for our farther journey. "We obeyed with alacrity his 
orders to collect a heap of dry brush during the day. To- 
wards midnight he showed us a hollow, where we could 
make a fire, secure from the prying eyes of' our neighbors. 
My master and two others then led up an old camel, which 
was too weak to follow the drove, and which they had 
bought for a mat, and made it kneel down. They then 
made a slip knot in a rope, which they put round his neck 
just under his chin, and drawing his head to the left side, 
fastened the rope to his tail. Then Sidi Hamet opened a 
vein in the right side of his neck, and let him bleed to 
death. The blood was caught in a copper kettle, and 
boiled, being stirred all the time until it was about the 
consistency of the liver of an ox, when they took it off the 
fire, and handed it to me, saying " eat Riley !" I did not 
wait to be bidden twice, but set to work with my compan- 
ions ; ' our enjoyment of food bordered on gluttony. 
' Although the night was far advanced and our business 
had been conducted with the greatest secresy, several of our 
hungry neighbors discovered it and came around us, to 
assist, as they said, in the slaughter of the animal. Our 
' dehcious food so attracted them that, spite of the prohibi- 
tions of our master, they possessed themselves of a con- 
siderable portion of it. They helped, very officiously, to 
skin the camel and take out the entails ; then they cooked 
all the bowels without washing them, together with the 
lungs and liver, in the dirty water that they found in the 
stomach of the beast, trying it every moment to see if it 
was done, while half a dozen hungry men, who pretended 



 

thfrt their hospitality would not allow them to stand idle 
while their guests were at work, cut up the camel, and 
contrived in the darkness to carry off almost half of it. 
Our masters, when they discovered the theft the next day, 
let it pass without notice, for it is a law among the Arabs 
to feed the hungry even if they suffer for it themselves. 
In the morning we dried the flesh and packed it away, 
but we baked the bones for our masters, who broke them 
between two stones and sucked out the marrow. 

Sidi Hamet provided us with some articles of clothing, 
and after we had taken leave of our companions, with 
heavy hearts, and held out to them the prospect of being 
speedily set at liberty through our exertions, we set off, 
taking a southeasterly course that we might find some 
spring that would yield us a supply of water. Soon the 
aspect of the desert changed, and instead of the hard soil 
covered with stones, we saw around us now, nothing but 
small burning, hot heaps of sand, into which our feet sunk 
at every step. We had preferred walking to tl weary 
riding, but the heat of the ground compelled us to mount 
the camels, and from their high backs we discovered as 
far as the eye could reach, countless high sandhills ; soon 
we were in the midst of them. Terror seized us at the 
sight of these mountains of loose sand which lay around 
us on every side like drifted snow, sometimes several hun- 
dred feet high, and often threatened to bury our little 
party alive. There was no path ta guide us out of this 
labyrinth, and the wind which had cooled us refreshingly 
when almost fainting under the vertical rays of the sun 
was now our most dreaded enemy. The sand, whirled 



 

about by the wind, sometimes wholly impeded c it pro- 
gress ; we- could not even see each other in the thick 
cloud of it that enveloped us. 

So the days passed on amid the severest sufferings, for 
a month ; Sidi Hamet provided for us as well as he could 
tinder the circumstances, but his brother Seid was continu- 
ally threatening and maltreating us; the two brothers 
were ceaselessly disputing about us, and their quarrels 
increased as we approached nearer the Morocco boundary. 
One day as I and my companions were wandering on, faint 
and exhausted, only kept alive by a dim spark of hope in 
our hearts, Seid suddenly commanded us to stand still; 
Sidi Hamet, who was riding on a few steps before us, 
noticed it and commanded us to proceed ; then Seid seized 
upon Horace and one other of our company, decl ared that 
they were his property, and that he was going to sell them 
to an Arab who had been travelling with us for several 
days. Then Sidi Hamet's anger was kindled; be sprang 
from his camel, rushed upon his brother and freed my two 
companions. Like lions the two brothers now fell upon 
each other, wrestling furiously, they attempted to throw 
each other upon the ground. As this did not succeed they 
seized their guns, retired a few paces apart in angry haste, 
and took aim ; the least pressure of the trigger and both 
would have fallen ; we stood dumb with horror. 

" God in heaven !" I cried, " have mercy upon us and 
upon these brothers, that they may not commit murder !" 

At the same moment I heard two shots, and thought 
they must both have fallen, but I soon saw that Sidi 
Hamet, having quickly irecovered his mastery of himself 



 

had fired both barrels into the air, while, baring bis breast, 
he advanced towards his brother with a firm step, and said 
touchingly : 

" I am now unarmed ; shoot if you wish to slake your , 
anger in your benefactor's blood ; your brother's heart does 
not tremble before your ball."
