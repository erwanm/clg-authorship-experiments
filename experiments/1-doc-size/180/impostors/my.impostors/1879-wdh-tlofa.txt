She put her hand upon his arm, confidently 
enough, and they began to walk up and down the 
stretch of open deck together. 

" Well, " said Staniford, " did Mr. Dunham con- 
vince you all ? " 

" I think he talks beautifully about it," replied 
Lydia, with quaint stiffness. 

" I am glad you see what a very good fellow he 
is. I have a real affection for Dunham." 

" Oh, yes, he 's good. At first it surprised me. 
I mean " — 

" No, no," Staniford quickly interrupted, " why 
did it surprise you to find Dunham good? " 

" I don't know. You don't expect a person to be 
serious who is so — so " — 

" Handsome ? " 

" No, — so — I don't know just how to say it : 
fashionable." 

Staniford laughed. " Why, Miss Blood, you 're 
fashionably dressed yourself, not to go any farther, 
and you 're serious." 

" It 's different with a man," the girl explained. 

"Well, then, how about me?" asked Staniford. 
" Am I too well dressed to be expected to be se- 
rious ? " 

" Mr. Dunham always seems in earnest," Lydia 
answered, evasively. 



 

" And you think one can't be in earnest without 
being serious ? " Lydia suffered one of those silences 
to ensue in which Staniford had already found him- 
self helpless. He knew that he should be forced to 
break it : and he said, with a little spiteful mock- 
ing, " I suppose the young men of South Bradfield 
are both serious and earnest." 

" How ? " asked Lydia. 

" The young men of South Bradfield." 

" I told you that there were none. They all go 
away." 

" Well, then, the young men of Springfield, of 
Keene, of Greenfield." 

" I can't tell. I am not acquainted there." 

Staniford had begun to have a disagreeable suspicion that her ready consent to walk up and down 
with a young man in the moonlight might have come 
from a habit of the kind. But it appeared that her 
fearlessness was like that of wild birds in those des- 
ert islands where man has never come. The dis- 
covery gave him pleasure out of proportion to its 
importance, and he paced back and forth in a silence 
that no longer chafed. Lydia walked very well, 
and kept his step with rhythmic unison, as if they 
were walking to music together. " That *s the time 
in her pulses," he thought, and then he said, " Then 
you don't have a great deal of social excitement, I 
suppose, — dancing, and that kind of thing ? 
Though perhaps you don't approve of dancing ? " 

" Oh, yes, I like it. Sometimes the summer 
boarders get up little dances at the hotel." 



 

" Oh, the summer boarders ! " Stamford had 
overlooked them. " The young men get them up, 
and invite the ladies ? " he pursued. 

" There are no young men, generally, among the 
summer boarders. The ladies dance together. Most 
of the gentlemen are old, or else invalids." 

" Oh ! " said Staniford. 

" At the Mill Village, where I 've taught two 
winters, they have dances sometimes, — the mill 
hands do." 

" And do you go ? " 

" No. They are nearly all French Canadians 
and Irish people." 

"Then you like dancing because there are no 
gentlemen to dance with ? " 

" There are gentlemen at the picnics." 

" The picnics ? " 

" The teachers' picnics. They have them every 
summer, in a grove by the pond." 

There was, then, a high-browed, dyspeptic high- 
school principal, and the desert-island theory was 
probably all wrong. It vexed Staniford, when he 
had so nearly got the compass of her social life, to 
find this unexplored corner in it. 

" And I suppose you are leaving very agreeable 
friends among the teachers ? " 

" Some of them are pleasant. But I don't know 
them very well. I 've only been to one of the pic- 
nics." 

Staniford drew a long, silent breath. After all, 



 

he knew everything. He mechanically dropped a 
little the arm on which her hand rested, that it 
might slip farther within. Her timid remoteness 
had its charm, and he fell to thinking, with amuse- 
ment, how she who was so subordinate to him was, 
in the dimly known sphere in which he had been 
groping to find her, probably a person of authority 
and consequence. It satisfied a certain domineering 
quality in him to have reduced her to this humble 
attitude, while it increased the protecting tender- 
ness he was beginning to have for her. His mind 
went off further upon this matter of one's different 
attitudes toward different persons ; he thought of 
men, and women too, before whom he should in- 
stantly feel like a boy, if he could be confronted 
with them, even in his present lordliness of mood. 
In a fashion of his when he convicted himself of 
anything, he laughed aloud. Lydia shrank a little 
from him, in question. " I beg your pardon," he 
said. " I was laughing at something I happened 
to think of. Do you ever find yourself struggling 
very hard to be what you think people think you 
are c 

" Oh, yes," replied Lydia. " But I thought no 
one else did." 

" Everybody does the thing that we think no one 
else does," said Staniford, sententiously. 

" I don't know whether I quite like it," said 
Lydia. " It seems like hypocrisy. It used to worry 
me. Sometimes I wondered if I had any real self. 



 

I seemed to be just what people made me, and a 
different person to each." 

" I 'm glad to hear it, Miss Blood. We are com- 
panions in hypocrisy. As we are such nonentities 
we shall not affect each other at all." Lydia 
laughed. " Don't you think so ? What are you
